# Sales Maximizers

Sales maximizers enhance offerings and the sales funnel by adding opportunities to increase the perceived value of your unique sales propositions. They leverage the desire and goodwill developed with the user up to a point.

Effective sales maximizers are timely (appearing at the right time on screen), always add value to the original offer, and are relevant or congruent with the buyer persona.

There are many kinds. Let’s go through the list:

• **Up-sells and down-sells**. We’ve already covered this in Chapter 14, Power of Sales Funnels. Keep in mind that this is the first sales maximizer you should consider.

• **Cross-sells**. Suggest products related to the one they’re buying. If they’re buying a camera, suggest podcasting lights, a tripod, selfie stick, or even a course on photography or videography.

• **Value ladder**. A more strategic approach to upsells and cross-sells. Value ladders aim to sell a solution, like a podcaster studio kit with a mic, lights, and more, instead of just a digital camera. Another approach is attaching services, such as professional assembly for furniture.

• **Bonus**. Add something you normally wouldn’t sell on its own as a bonus to the offer. Let them add it for free or as an upsell or cross-sell, and consider limiting the bonus to entice people to close the deal soon.

• **Value stack**. Basically, many bonuses at the same original price or a marginally higher price. The idea is that the value of these bonuses “stacks up” so the price becomes less relevant in their mind. Be cautious not to overpromise and underdeliver.

• **Scarcity and urgency**. Adding mechanisms like countdown timers, low stock alerts, limiting the number of units per purchase, or using organic scarcity like available seats in a theater. Note: ensure the scarcity or urgency tactic is credible.

• **Exclusivity**. If the offer is exclusive, remind them about it. For instance, “exclusive offer for our Platinum Members”. If using gamification, offer special discounts for upsells or coupons to trade points.

• **One-time offers**. Timely opportunities offered at checkout. Similar to an upsell, but make clear the one-time offer expires and won’t be available again.

• **Extended warranties**. While less exciting, they can work. The more comprehensive the warranty, the better.

• **Subscriptions**. Subscriptions (and free trials) are enticing sales maximizers.

• **Financing**. Offer financing options to make purchases more affordable.

• **Bulk discounts**. Basically, the more you buy, the better the price. Like “buy 10 and get a 10% discount”.

• **Barter**. More suitable for personal sales, offer your product or services at retail price in exchange for another’s. It’s a strategic way to get resources at a discount.

• **Bundles**. They are slightly cheaper than buying separately. Naturally bundle products often bought together.

• **Loyalty programs**. Test giving small rewards quickly rather than big rewards long-term. Can be mixed with gamification tactics.

• **Up and down anchors**. Show an expensive product first, then the main offer (down anchor), or explain how expensive it is for them to do it on their own. An up anchor shows how little extra they pay for the premium option.

• **Tiered pricing**. Similar to anchoring, but offering different tiers with clear differences. It’s recommended no more than 3 tiers are shown, but in some cases, a little more may work.

• **Gifts**. Adding a simple gift, like credit, a memento, or collectibles. The gift shouldn’t feel cheap.

• **Enhanced service benefits**. For instance, a product comes with specialized software or personalized services.

• **Dynamic pricing**. A more complex strategy, automatically adapting price based on recent sales.

• **Social proof**. Show statistics or real-time information on recent purchases, how many people are looking at the product page, total sales, or social badges.

• **Memberships**. Build on exclusivity. Members get early access, better service, private content, and are part of an “insider’s circle”.

• **Flash sales**. Great to incentivize recurrent visits but need a large catalog. Randomized discounts that last at most 24 hours, with low limits.

• **Product demonstrations**. Seeing the product in action while describing benefits and WOW Factors is an effective sales strategy. Nowadays, this is called “live social selling”.

• **Customization mechanisms**. Elements on the page that enable customizing or configuring the order, like building a PC or equipping a car.

• **Gamification tactics**. Gamification builds consuming habits (repurchases) based on rewards and status building. Think of “points” people get for buying, reviewing, and interacting.

• **Referrals**. They allow for better deals to the referring party, letting them buy at a discount or access perks and benefits. Always test for referrals.

• **Pre-order incentives**. Not all checkouts are for existing products. Pre-orders typically have discounts for early buying. Add a guarantee, like a money-back guarantee if the product hasn’t shipped in a certain timeframe.

• **Seasonal dimensions**. Any other sales maximizer but with a seasonal flavor, like a seasonal bundle or bonus.

• **Product samples**. Add product samples to the order, and a note on how to order them.

• **Free trials**. Treat the buyer with a free trial or extended free trial (depending on the value of the purchase).

## The Effective Checkout Page

Profit maximizers depend on your checkout page being well-made. A well-made checkout page includes clear, simple, and flowing messaging and mechanisms. For instance, an offer bump (an up-sell via checkbox) should be simple and contained near the checkout button, without overriding or blocking the ongoing checkout process.

The checkout page has psychological weight to the buyer because it’s the last “barrier” before deciding to buy. The buyer is looking for reasons not to buy while being sold. That’s why selling is tricky, and your key web pages need to address this reality.

Now we’ll cover how to structure an effective checkout page:

• **Order summary**: A breakdown of what they’re buying, with clear sections showing quantities, variations (size, color, etc.), discounts/savings, shipping, and taxes. Transparency is key.

• **Countdown timers**: At the top of the page, ideally towards a corner, show a countdown timer if applicable. 15 minutes is standard, but for events, there is typically a 5-minute window.

• **Up-sells (offer bumps) and cross-selling**: Below the order summary, suggest more or better versions of the same product or complementary products or bundles.

• **Discount codes**: Close and above the checkout button, put a text field for discount codes if applicable. Keep interacting mechanisms close to each other.

• **Secure payment badges**: Below the checkout button, add secure payment badges to convey security.

• **Customer support**: Optionally add a chat widget and a visible phone number to help people with the process.

• **Progress indicators**: Optionally add progress indicators showing how close they are to finishing the process. Ideally, start them in the middle.

• **Guest checkout**: Offer guest checkout options by not requiring them to make a user account.

• **Social proof**: Add social proof of how many people have recently bought this offer or even real-time activity. This may include stock levels with messages like “order soon, almost sold-out”.

• **Warranty**: As an up-sell, consider adding a warranty or extended protection plans.

• **Gift-wrapping**: Optionally offer a gift-wrapping option.

• **Subscription**: Optionally offer a subscription option if the product should be rebought recurrently.

• **Gamification**: If using gamification tactics like points, offer an easy way to redeem them into discounts or benefits right then and there.

• **Exit-intent popups**: Controversial, but consider having exit-intent popups that offer a last-minute discount or a bonus if the buyer is about to abandon the checkout page.

• **Payment options**: Offer more than one payment option, from credit cards and PayPal to installments.

After they click the checkout button, don’t show a blank page. Show a page indicating that the payment is being processed and then the thank you page. Consider having a mechanism that allows re-visiting the checkout page without losing most of the previously selected information and options if the checkout needs to be reviewed again.
