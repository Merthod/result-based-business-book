# 20. Competitive Advantage

In a capitalist environment where a simplistic definition of a free market is about an open and fair platform for anyone to create a business, a need arises for business owners. If two or more businesses compete side by side, selling the same products and services, how will consumers know who to choose?

In the old days, there were only a few small businesses that served the local community. But as some businesses developed working systems that were attractive to consumers, such as the fast-food revolution and research that led to innovative products everyone had to have, like kitchen appliances, new ambitions started arising. Business consultants started emphasizing the idea of competition as war and winning market share as taking everyone else’s customers, as growing businesses challenged local businesses for the same buyers. Then the environment only got more complex. Some local businesses just couldn’t compete with the franchise or conglomerate of stores under the same brand. These big businesses had better and better advantages as their economies scaled.

Big companies could produce products for cheaper and thus could price aggressively, attacking their rivals relentlessly. They could control their supply chain. They attained more bargaining power in the market. They could add quality standards to their working systems and get consistent results. And more importantly, they had a lot of capital, so they could invest wildly in having big fancy stores, aggressive advertising campaigns, and aggressive research and development of new products.

Nowadays, as capitalism has evolved into modern times, including spaces like food, technology, pharma, banks, and many other concentrated fields, some frighteningly well-capitalized conglomerates were able to acquire smaller businesses, eating their competition like people-eating monsters, sometimes just to tear them up and sell them for parts. There is a famous image showing how ten big companies own most of the brands we find in the supermarket in the United States.

Business-as-warfare just fits too well into capitalism. Competition against other businesses and competition against nature itself. Capitalism is also a system present in most countries, so this has enabled globalization geopolitics, so economies have focused on their strongest capital and import everything else, at least to a point. However, as it usually happens, we fall into external dependency, and that’s very risky business, especially for a nation.

Why do I tell you this?

Because in modern times, competition isn’t only about competing with your fellow neighbor who opened a store down the same street, but also a corporation that may have a big central store, sell online, and not only that, but also foreign businesses of all sizes, who might open a local store or also sell online. Markets have opened their doors, windows, and even chimneys wide open for anyone to somehow come in. Even competing with substitute products. This means they don’t compete with you toe-to-toe with whatever you’re offering, like web design, but create a different solution that delivers the ultimate desired result and resulting transformation. For instance, many small retail businesses may stop hiring your web design services to make an e-store because they can sell directly through TikTok and Instagram much easier and with less risk, as your store needs not only to be created and working properly but also promoted, serviced, and secured. If a small retailer can forget about all those setup and management costs and just invest that into ads that generate sales in a store that’s basically created for free, already has a lot of followers, and can checkout right then and there, what are they going to choose?

This is why it’s of vital importance to build a durable competitive advantage for your business.

Markets work in sort of a balance, where the businesses with durable competitive advantages weigh more and thus win. This is true in the stock market, where investors get rich with them. And with sales, those businesses with unfair advantages sell a lot more.

These advantages come in all colors and forms. For instance, a tailor that knows sophisticated methods of stitching so drape is perfect, knows and has quality materials, and is located in a prime location where rich people abound, will have an unfair advantage against a tailor with just adequate knowledge, adequate cloths, and an adequate location that pays less rent.

Again, this is Darwinian; the most apt capitalists survive. In business, you need to know what kind of advantages create the lasting business you want to create, as not all advantages will have the same weight in all categories in all industries.

For instance, having a hotel with great service, where the tested competitive advantage is refined service, may not be fruitful, as many other hotels have had that and refined their service methods throughout the years. Also, having great locations may not be a durable competitive advantage, as many well-capitalized hotels already have prime locations. But many hotels have found success by niching out, creating boutique (more intimate) experiences at great locations. Turns out that being in an isolated cabin-like room instead of a room in a large building is great for those wanting higher levels of intimacy, or those boutique hotels where all rooms are in sort of a dock and have direct access to a not-too-wavy area of a greenish light blue sea, may indeed create durable competitive advantages since these businesses have unique offerings that resonate well with a segment of the profitable traveling market.

Modern value investors like Warren Buffett, who retain stocks for very long periods of time, deduce the existence of durable competitive advantage through the business finances. Warren focuses on businesses that do not need to change their product, like Coca-Cola, that have leadership in their market, consistent revenue and margins, easy-to-pay debt, and constantly repurchase their own stock, among other things.

To an investor like Warren Buffett, he didn’t invest early in Microsoft claiming he didn’t understand the space. And coming from his mindset, it’s understandable. Why would Microsoft's famous operating system, Windows, be on a durable competitive advantage if they need to improve on it often? If you’re a technology savvy, you might find it natural since the whole technology space is prone to change. But if your overall investing strategy is about holding stock for many years, how certain are you that the leading trading technology companies of today in their space will be the same of tomorrow?

Competitive advantage is not a definite science, as different investors might find durable competitive advantage in different perspectives. After being rejected by about 300 early investors, Uber did find a few who saw the potential and won big. They found a competitive advantage where most couldn’t that helped trailblaze Uber into the top of an already saturated, and even highly regulated, market everywhere—the personal public transportation, the taxi cab—while also creating modern market dynamics allowing everyone to have a secondary income driving their car around. However, as many of this kind of billionaire investors will tell you, luck was part of their success.

## 12 Types of Competitive Advantages

Virtually all sources of durable competitive advantages can be grouped into a few categories, but if yours doesn’t fit, don’t worry too much.

1. **Cost Leadership (Price):**
   The most basic form of competitive advantage. It is usually not recommended to pursue an advantage here unless you can do volume and have sustained access to cheaper sources, where cheaper doesn’t mean bad quality; you have a reputation to protect.

   - Economies of scale (production and supply chain are usually cheaper as you produce more).
   - Operational efficiency.
   - Cost-effective supply chain management.
   - Low-cost production processes.

2. **Differentiation:**
   Brands often fall in this area, where they showcase some level of uniqueness through a superior product or service, built of higher materials and efficient processes, and also benefiting from volume or scope, where your product and several related products benefit from cost-advantages to one another. Like apparel brands where the cost structure of making a garment also benefits that of another garment.

   - Unique product features.
   - Superior quality.
   - Innovative design.
   - Strong branding.

3. **Service:**
   Product-centered organizations benefit from having superior services in order to minimize returns and build relationships. Service-oriented businesses benefit from having higher levels of service that set a standard in whatever the business is in, either through customization or convenience.

   - Excellent customer service.
   - Technical support.
   - Customization and personalization.
   - Convenience and ease of use.

4. **Distribution:**
   If your forte is distribution, this process can benefit not only a large business of yours but also others as you open the model (network effects below).

   - Efficient supply chain and logistics.
   - Strategic location of facilities.
   - Effective inventory management.
   - Broad market coverage.

5. **Marketing:**
   If you are great with content distribution (being like an influencer), creating useful content, irresistible offers, and being easy to find and do business with, alas, someone always answers, the experience is consistent, you have effective funnels, and so on. These companies can also benefit from network effects as great marketing companies know how to create demand.

   - Strong brand recognition.
   - Effective advertising and promotional strategies.
   - Superior market intelligence and customer insights.
   - Strong online presence and digital marketing.

6. **Innovation:**
   An amazing but difficult area of differentiation as innovations aren’t always innovative (they mature) and it’s not easy to always be on the front of every wave. This can be seen as a specialization of marketing focused on new products (launches) and patented products.

   - Research and development capabilities.
   - Intellectual property and patents.
   - Ability to bring new products to market quickly.
   - Continuous improvement and adaptation.

7. **Human Resources:**
   Sometimes your strength is in your workforce. If you have an effective, loyal, well-trained workforce, you’ll have a competitive advantage others will envy.

   - Talented and skilled workforce.
   - Strong company culture.
   - Effective training and development programs.
   - High employee satisfaction and retention.

8. **Technology:**
   An advantage that was put as secondary in the past, but technology has fundamentally revolutionized every industry, from instant communication applications to innovative tech-products.

   - Advanced IT systems and infrastructure.
   - Proprietary software or algorithms.
   - Data analytics and business intelligence.
   - Automation and AI integration.

9. **Network Effects:**
   Network effects are about optimizing the economies at work of a business. It’s also about highest and best-use theory.

   - Platform strategies where the value increases with the number of users.
   - Strong partnerships and alliances.
   - Effective collaboration and integration with suppliers and customers.

10. **Switching Costs:**
    Mostly a defensive competitive advantage, but an effective one. Making it hard for people to leave you, ethically (but many organizations, even famous ones, can draw a gray-to-darker line successfully), and also where value increases as your own ecosystem grows and flourishes.

    - High costs for customers to switch to competitors.
    - Loyalty programs and customer retention strategies.
    - Proprietary systems or standards that lock in customers.

11. **Regulatory and Legal:**
    Some businesses benefit from this know-how, especially in highly regulated industries. But also businesses who develop strong branding and want to benefit from licensing or where licensing is the core of the business model.

    - Favorable government policies or regulations.
    - Strong legal protections (e.g., patents, trademarks).
    - Compliance and risk management capabilities.

12. **Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR):**
    All businesses are tied to their local environment, but sadly, not all environments are equally respected and well-treated. Those businesses that actually show they care and respect their environment, including natural, economic, social, cultural, and historic values and customs.
    - Environmentally friendly practices.
    - Social and community engagement.
    - Ethical business practices.

As we previously stated, don’t worry too much if yours doesn’t easily fit in any of these, but consider adding at least one of them to yours.

For example, if your competitive advantage is your superior selection of products, you might strengthen it with differentiation and/or others if relevant. Say your selection helps manufacturers comply with their own local regulatory requirements, then you add number 11 above too.

You don’t need to pursue all at once and much less all of them. Focus on the one or two most critical and where you see most opportunity and create your Unique Selling Proposition around them, plus the offering itself. However, do yourself a common-sense consult and also think of which would hurt the most to your sales and brand, not having.

If you need to, ask a few target audience people you can for what kind of elements would make a good fit for them (for you as a supplier) and what wouldn’t. Sometimes it’s reputation (especially in bigger businesses), support availability, product ready to go, an ISO certification, and so on.
