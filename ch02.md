# 2. A business is born when a sale is made

This is a classic definition of a business.

It was obvious to me when I started out, but I rediscovered this simple truth after seeing so many startups struggle, where even the most basic business principles are disregarded in the pursuit of innovative ways to create business. It's a hit-or-miss approach, with the highest probability of the latter.

A business is any endeavor that generates sales.

Sales are the ultimate result that a business produces in order to exist. However, some analysis must be done to ensure that the sale is either profitable or viable according to a strategic plan.

What I mean to say is that not all sales are equally profitable. Some are not intended to be. For instance, in a marketing strategy called "loss-leader," a business intentionally makes a loss on the first sale in order to make a profit on future sales. For example, Netflix hardly makes a profit from you after giving you a free month or charging you only $10 a month. The profit is made in the long term.

In any case, once we understand that a business needs sales, we also need to understand that all sales are not equal, whether they are loss-leaders or not.

It's easy to see that once you convince a person to give you money, a sale is made. But then what? Do you go on to convince another person and so on? If so, then you are in for some trouble. To make this plan work, you would need to attract a lot of new customers to see your offer and convince them to say yes. This is too difficult. Convincing a new customer each time is tiresome and expensive, both in terms of time and money, as they are more skeptical than someone who has already bought from you.

The other way is to somehow retain a repeat customer. You don't need as many new customers to see your offer, but you do need some kind of communication channel to encourage a customer to come back for more.

We need a plan to generate a recurring stream of sales.

Moreover, after the sale is made, we need to fulfill that sale. If we sell hamburgers, we need to cook them. To cook them, we need raw materials or ingredients. We also need the skill to cook them correctly and other materials to package them. We also need quality standards to ensure the burger is edible and that we won't be sued for food poisoning.

We can't stop there. We need a kitchen, and probably some tables where people can sit and eat in an area authorized to be a restaurant, so our house probably won't suffice. Whatever the location, it must comply with cleanliness and service regulations, have restrooms available, and we need to keep everything clean and in good condition. The more neglected a restaurant looks in terms of maintenance, the less attractive it usually is to go there, and the fewer people go, the fewer sales are made.

Having all of that is still not enough. How will people know about our restaurant? We need at least some form of advertising and promotion. Thinking strategically, we need not only to inform people about our place but also to give them a compelling reason to come and taste our burgers again and again.

We started with the simple goal of selling a hamburger, and soon we needed a plan to support an infrastructure that enables recurring sales and thus a business. Selling just one, or just ten, or just a hundred burgers does not create a recurring business, after all. Selling tens or hundreds of burgers daily does sound like a recurring business.
