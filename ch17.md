# 17. Pricing

Setting prices is both an art and a science. Pricing is a key strategic activity for businesses since it alone can make or break them. Many businesses that are handled unprofessionally set prices as cost plus profit margin. Say a product you’re making has a per unit COGS of $14, and you set a 30% fixed margin, so $18.20 plus sales tax if applicable.

This kind of pricing is not bad, but it is also not great. At least you probably won’t be suffering losses if your margin covers all operating expenses, and you end the month with net profit. The problem is that your profits will be low, which signals two things to investors (remember that you should also have the investor hat on):

1. The business is in a highly competitive environment.
2. The business does not have a durable competitive advantage, plus possible poor management.

Both are bad signs for an investor, and further analysis will surface the business economics that drive it. For instance, Costco may have a low net profit, but they are in a highly competitive market, plus their strategic steering is of cost advantages. They compensate lower margins with sales volume plus membership renewals.

Depending on who you ask, some will say that a 10-15% profit margin is a bare minimum for a business to be considered healthy. If you asked Warren Buffett, he’d probably tell you his bar is much higher, at least 40%, as some of the books that showcase his methods suggest.

To an investor like Warren Buffett, a consistent high-profit margin is an early indication of a durable competitive advantage, but other metrics will confirm it as there are no absolutes.

Businesses with strong USPs, competitive advantages, and intellectual capital can charge higher prices because the market understands and accepts their propositions as better than the generic lowest-priced product in the category.

If you’re just starting out, you don’t have this market acceptance yet, but the USP enables you to justify a higher price through differentiation in your marketing and sales messaging. If you are offering personalized expert service, a buyer will understand that a higher price covers that.

To get the basic concepts out of the way:

- **USP**: The Unique Selling Proposition makes a differentiated promise typically in the lines of better service, pricing, experience, safety, innovation, irresistible offer, and other kinds that we discussed in Chapter 11 on Value Propositions and Headlines. It is the more direct way to convey value to the mind of the buyer and build an effective brand.
- **Competitive Advantage**: These are economic forces (external) that the business can leverage (internal) to have unfair advantages. For instance, being the sole supplier in a category makes the market depend on you, while being one of many suppliers takes away a lot of this advantage. We will discuss it more in Chapter 18.
- **Intellectual Capital**: These are the processes, procedures including quality practices, knowledge, and strategic direction that allow a business to sustain its USP and Competitive Advantages long-term. We’ll discuss it more in Chapter 19.

Back to pricing.

Depending on how these three big variables play in your business, your approach to establishing pricing will vary.

There’s a part of the price that you set logically. As we already said, cost plus profit margin is a basic and logical formula to set a price.

There are others like copying the pricing of your competitors and using value to price.

Let’s quickly discuss these three:

**Pricing based on competitors**

- Easy to set prices.
- Prices already accepted by the target market.
- Good to quickly position your offer value-wise. For instance, having prices similar to premium brands helps to compare you to them instead of the low-cost ones.
- It can limit your profit margin since it doesn’t relate to your costs.
- Competitors might be pricing wrong.

**Cost plus profit margin (also known as markup pricing)**

- Always makes a profit per sale.
- Depending on the margin and sales volume, profits might be low.
- Cumbersome if the cost structure is complex.
- Easy to calculate in many cases, nevertheless.
- Might not reflect the actual value of your offering.

**Multiplier pricing**

- A variant of the cost-plus method, multiplies by a factor your cost to determine pricing.
- Mainly used in the manufacturing to distribution space.
- The basic model is 50-50-50, meaning the manufacturer adds 50% profit, the distributor another 50%, and the retailer another 50%.
- Premium to luxurious products usually use a factor of 3x to 15x depending on their brand recognition and other factors, like being scarce. This means that a product that costs $100 to manufacture could be selling up to $1,500.
- Can be controversial if the quality is not on par with the pricing.

**Subscription pricing**

- Extremely profitable in the long term and easier to sell.
- Creates a need to minimize churn (cancellations).
- Can require a long time before turning a profit.
- Extremely good for valuations (if you want to eventually sell the business or use aggressive financing).
- Can be saturated (many businesses have become subscription-based) so there might be less competitive advantage for having this kind of pricing.

**Tiered Pricing**

- Offering different versions of the product or service at increasing price points based on features, usage, or other factors. Good for choosing the best option for each use case.
- Good if each tier has a name to choose easier, like “starter”, “professional”, “agency”. Also, good if marking what’s the most popular one.
- Too many options may be confusing, risking losing sales. 3 recommended, 4-5 if there is a compelling reason.
- A tier price may be used as anchoring so others look like better deals. For instance, if 3-tiered, 15-20-50 may put the second tier feel like a deal. Or if 20-40-50, the price difference between the second and last is low so the higher tier may look like the best value.
- Good option if having many features to compare. Better to compare among your plans than among competitors.

**Usage-Based Pricing (Pay-As-You-Go)**

- Convenient and flexible pricing that creates savings by only charging for what is used.
- Can be unprofitable in the short term.
- Needs strong, clear metrics to avoid confusion and customer service issues.
- Pricing can be confusing if mixing different services or having many configurations.
- Managed services like AWS, cloud storage, and utility bills are some examples.

**Freemium**

- A risky model that doesn’t guarantee sales but is great to penetrate a market quickly.
- Usually needs a secondary income source, like selling advertising space.
- Innovators can get fast growth in brand recognition.
- Good if having an ecosystem of products and a central one is the freemium.
- Need to know the expected economics because metrics can be misleading, for instance, expect high churn rates, but actual sales might be profitable.

**Dynamic Pricing**

- A price changes unexpectedly to the user, based on an algorithm that changes it based on demand, time, or customer behavior.
- Uber, Airbnb, supermarkets, Amazon, airlines, and many other big and successful companies use this type of pricing.
- Not good for everyone. For instance, not great for smaller companies with few products as it is too much complexity. Implementation tends to be complex and requires experts or software that has the capability plus training.
- Requires a machine learning or AI algorithm to work.
- Can dynamically test the best prices that sell the most given a second cross variable, like zone, season, hour of day, or region.

**Bundle Pricing**

- Grouping products can maximize sales at checkout and before, by the buyer realizing the savings to be made compared to buying individually.
- Groupings can be as up-sells (like a full meal at a fast-food restaurant), cross-sells (like the “frequently bought together” feature on Amazon) or packages like spa packages or cable TV packages.
- Can be confusing if abused, risking lost buyers.
- In some cases, it can require machine learning to figure out effective cross-selling deals, so it can be complex.
- It’s good to make a complex sale a simple one, by combining several solutions into a larger simple solution. For instance, a security software may need to sell the antivirus, firewall, activity tracking cleaner, VPN, and other specialized software to the casual buyer, but it’s simpler to bundle as the “Business-grade Security Package” or “Home Package” and then probably tier by the number of devices they want to protect.

**Penetration Pricing**

- Set a very low price (upping it later) or a loss-leader to get customers quickly. A loss-leader is a very cheap first part or free first month, and then charging a normal price.
- It is set on the premise that getting the second sale is easier.
- Serves better when there’s a subscription or continuous sales cycles.
- Helps validate a market quickly, but the information can be untrustworthy if you then up the price and see a sales slump that continues being unprofitable. Great tests validate at real and normal conditions, and a very low price is not a real and normal condition.
- Better with aggressive marketing funnels that push the second sale soon, many times immediately.

**Skimming**

- For innovative products. They start at a high price and then you lower it as you scale, meaning you get a lot of sales and refine your supply chain for manufacturing and product.
- Skimming works better in big markets but new niches. For instance, a high-end transparent TV is a niche product, but in a big market.
- If you need skimming, there’s a risk that all your research and development becomes a sunk cost if sales aren’t going as expected.
- Early innovations cater to a very small segment of a market.
- Competitors might piggyback on your efforts and thus dilute your differentiation.

**Value-based pricing**

- Can be amazingly profitable if you have a USP, Competitive Advantages, and Intellectual Capital (even with only some of these).
- It focuses on value (what you bring to the table) rather than your own costs.
- Hard to commoditize.
- You need to position yourself in the buyer’s mind to be even considered, which can be a challenge.
- Once established, it can help reach long-term strategic goals fairly easily.

The story doesn’t end here.

Pricing is a key strategic activity that is largely dependent on your business goals. Let’s see some pricing dimensions based on your business context:

- **Your capacity**: What relation between pricing and labor do you want? Do you want to grow into having a lot of employees or having a more comfortable, less stressful business management-wise? Consider pricing that would keep around 80% of your business capacity busy at least.
- **Gold, Silver, and Bronze coins**: What level of coins does your target market(s) represent? How much can they afford? Don’t be shy to aim for the Gold coins if you want to. Typically, many entrepreneurs focus on the Bronze coin markets which are the least wealthy and in many cases most difficult customers. You may combine two sequentially, but it’s not recommended all three. For instance, Porsche sells cars to the Gold coin markets, but Silver coin markets buy clothing and other kinds of more accessible products.
- **Branding**: How Premium or luxurious is your brand on a scale of 0 to 10?
- **The cost-structure**.
- **The product**: How unique (hard to copy), innovative, or necessary is it?
- **Supply**: Many direct or indirect rivals might limit your pricing range. This considers that your product and/or offering is easily comparable to others (ideally it shouldn’t).
- **Demand**: Is there a tangible “hunger” for the product? How big is it?
- **Competitors' price range** relative to their own USPs, from the commodity to the most exclusive.
- **Trends**: What does the market (experts, reviewers, etc.) say about the market, pricing trends in the short to long terms, and the offerings both from established brands as well as the innovators? The car industry is a clear example, where analysts compare prices, tax benefits, and other considerations between Chinese electric vehicles against the American offerings.

## Pricing Devices

In the field, there are a number of pricing devices or tactics that will help push conversions a notch. This is the last thing you should be thinking about after all we have covered in this chapter.

- **Price anchors**: Set a price anchor early and then show savings. We saw up and down anchors with Profit Maximizers in the previous chapter.
- **Compare apples to oranges**: If your membership site is $9.99 a month, compare that to a Starbucks coffee a month, or if higher prices, a Starbucks coffee a day. Choose any well-known relatable product to be your oranges, like an average dinner out, their TV subscription, and so on.
- **Digital 7**: Digital products such as books and courses tend to have better conversions from prices ending in 7 (no cents) like 7, 17, 27, 47, 97, 497, and so on. Test it!
- **Affordable 9**: Products that want to convey great pricing tend to make a greater impact with prices ending in nine (including cents). $9.99, $19.99, $99.99, $1,999, and so on.
- **Remove the currency sign ($)**: Test conversions by simply removing the sign, including listing pages that show many prices (like search or catalog) and product pages. Do show the currency if you get many international visits, although that’s usually configured visibly at the top of the page.
- **If showing deals (discounts) make them visible**: Cross out the original price and highlight the deal price with a vibrant color and larger font.
- **Prices should stand on their own feet**: Don’t embellish, justify through your own personal beliefs assuming them. If a price is high for you, don’t reflect that thought to the buyer. Leave your personal thoughts at the door. Price objections come from their own beliefs and only then value must be conveyed and pricing options such as installments, plans, packages, or a last-minute small discount offered.
- **Buying is also entertainment and a game for many people**: Show information that makes them feel like winners (gamification) such as “lowest price in the last 30 days” or “prices will go up on DD/MM” or a countdown timer (already discussed in the previous chapter).
- **If considering discounts, prefer them in packages or bonuses**: A heavily discounted bonus will still get you at least full price in the original offer.

## The dangers of price discounting

Discounts are a popular way to negotiate price so it can be accepted without much objection. However, they’re dangerous and if mishandled, they can kill your business.

First, never give a discount without a solid reason.

It is very common to see businesses giving out discounts that nobody asked for. Yes, they can make people buy, but at a high cost.

As in anything, every decision you make in business comes with tradeoffs. Yes, a discount can increase sales, but consider that the costs never change. Discounts do nothing to reduce costs.

Say you have a monthly sales volume of 100 products at $100 each, so $100,000 total a month. Then you give a 10% discount next month. If we sold the same 100 products, at now $90 each, our revenue would be $90,000. We need to compensate the $10,000 “ghost” cost our discount gave us. So how many extra sales would make up for that? We divide $10,000 by $90 and it gives out about 12 extra sales; when dealing with decimals we always round up high.

Our discount idea makes us need to sell 112 products instead of 100 products to make the same amount of money. More work. And again, operating expenses plus variable costs don’t go down, so we also have less profit per product.

A 10% discount isn’t enticing enough for most businesses to get the ball rolling. It’s common to see bigger discounts to really excite people. We might find 20, 30, or even a 50% discount. In this latter case, we need to sell double our normal inventory just to make the same amount of money, nothing more. It’s quite a lot of extra work for nothing!

Keep this in mind and run the numbers.

That’s why conscious marketers prefer adding a bonus, and even giving the bonus a hefty discount so we don’t risk our bottom line.

Discounts can affect your business in a few nasty ways:

- Make normal buyers become discount buyers, waiting for the discount to buy.
- Devalue your brand.
- Attract many one-time buyers, lowering the value per subscriber that you get on your funnels (people who gave you their email).
- Make people question your quality standards if your discounts aren’t justified.
- If you do value-based pricing, it decreases the quality of service as you need to devote the same customer service resources for more buyers.

### How to justify a discount?

A discount isn’t always a negative, especially if you have a valid reason to give it out.

For instance, you need to clear your warehouse because new stuff is coming, so you make a clearance sale. You need to get rid of merchandise that is close to expiring, so you put the merchandise in your outlet at a hefty discount. You’re celebrating your anniversary and want to offer a week-long savings event for existing buyers. You acknowledge you’re crazy and want to test the experiment to see how many sales you gain. This isn’t rocket science.

### What alternatives are there?

As we previously discussed, adding a bonus and maybe giving the bonus a discount may be better, or also give a discount if buying volume or a bundle.

If you find yourself relying on discounts too often, try dynamic pricing and create sections to showcase your deals and promotions, like “buy 3 of any these products and get free shipping”.

If your business relies on the deals side, focus on making it an entertaining experience making people return frequently and look for deals, while your site may also suggest products based on their behaviors and correlation (meaning cross-sales) between sales of the products they have bought recently.

### Prices convey a message

There are four main groups of consumers that can be derived from pricing:

- **Cost-seeking**: Look for the best deals and are loyal to pricing rather than brands.
- **Fashionistas**: Like to constantly consume a certain type of products, like a hobby, apparel, or makeup, and will look for brands that align with their disposable income, from cost-seeking to premium.
- **Premium-seeking**: Like the type of products of the cost-seeking but made with premium materials. Premium cars, premium food, premium apparel, and so on.
- **Luxury-connoisseurs**: People who understand well the raw value of a product and enjoy the luxurious side of it to an extreme with its exclusive perks. Super-luxury cars that have that extra attention for detail, highest-quality materials. Or the super-fast car that sacrifices comforts for the raw speed enjoyment. Bespoke suit tailoring with the best Persian fabrics. Pricing can vary as not all luxurious products are super expensive, but most are.

One could easily categorize a product based on context plus price.

Look at a shirt in a Walmart at $30 USD, and you know it’s for cost-seeking people. Look at the same shirt at a mall boutique at $60, and you’ll deduce it’s for fashionistas that will probably also buy the suit and the tie. Look at the shirt at a nice store at the same mall for $250, and you know it’s premium. Look at a tiny store with old wooden furniture, many small fabric samples per country, and a mature man with a measuring tape around their neck, and you’ll know that’s the luxury experience.

Prices should be congruent with the type of buyer you want to attract, and the discounts shouldn’t appeal too much to those outside those people. Some would go to the extreme and even recommend never giving a discount under any circumstance.

In service-oriented businesses, it can also be dangerous because if customers can talk between them and tell each other how much each they’re paying, more than one will get angry.

Your selling technique should adapt to the prices you are charging. Premium motivations may lead to premium pricing. As easy as that.

Pricing is also a factor in building competitive advantage; we will talk more about it in Chapter 19.
