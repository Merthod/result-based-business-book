# 5. The Marketing Process

Remember our magician example? Well, it’s incomplete. Now that you know why marketing is needed, and basically what it is (a process), you can build upon the example further.

You, as a magician, are smart and decide to hire a marketing agency to help you with programming and scheduling your events worldwide. You don’t have the time and energy to do this yourself, so you delegate. The agency learns about your preferred travel itinerary and programs all your shows accordingly. Not only that, but it creates advertising and social media content to make people want to see you. They’re introducing your new trick that promises to rock their world. It’s new, it’s fresh, and whoever goes to see your show this season will be the first ones seeing it ever.

The marketing agency is smart too. They know you’re not a diluted one-man show doing kids' birthday parties. They schedule big and chic theaters that both of you manage to pack full each show. Not only that, but the agency manages to charge premium prices compared to other magic shows, and even at the higher end of more generic entertainment shows, like concerts.

You’re happy. You manage to do what you love: magic. You also have a mindset to help your own brand by creating cool and exciting content that keeps viewers hooked. You also chose your marketing agency wisely. You manage to use their relationships to hook you up with other big names in the entertainment industry so you co-create content, invite them to your shows, and reach new audiences through them.

Before, you were an excellent magician. Now the world knows it and pays accordingly. You could argue that your show is an experience in its own right. You’re committed to creating the most avant-garde, exciting, and innovative magic show the world has ever seen.

Here we saw a lot of marketing stuff going on. It’s hard to grasp it all at once since marketing activities are varied. That’s why marketing academics created a memorable acronym they called “the Marketing Mix” to help keep an eye on all that marketing has to offer.

The Marketing Mix is composed of “4 Ps”: product, place, promotion, and price. It’s old but it still works just fine. Newer attempts to “modernize” have been tried, some coming up with “the 4 Cs” and “the 4 Es,” that I won’t bother to describe since it’s just more of the same old thing.

Keep in mind that the “4 Ps” is a mnemonic device, so the word may not perfectly fit what it’s supposed to represent.

## Product

Yes, marketing creates a product. Not only that, but it plans for it and recognizes that a product sits in a larger maturity cycle that helps understand where it is in the market, as in: Is it innovative? Is it mature and well-accepted? Is it decaying? How much time can one estimate for a product to go from one stage to another?

To create a product, you ideally know about a problem or challenge the market faces. The product is the “magic pill” that fixes it. There’s a fire, and there’s a working fire extinguisher nearby. Or you find a gold craze (trend) and sell the shovels and quicksilver.

In the marketing context, we need to keep in mind key things when designing and commercializing a product:

Is it sustainable? Meaning, are the raw materials easily acquirable, scalable to get if we need to sell more product, and hopefully as little damaging to the environment as possible?
One sad truth of how this very first question is violated is seen in the textile world. Many brands push their manufacturing to Bangladesh, one of the most polluted countries because of it, and also impoverished, in order to make the garments as affordable as possible to make room for big profits.

There are a bunch of factors that can affect your ability to make a product:

- Availability of raw materials. There’s a saying that states that you have to grow along with your suppliers (okay, maybe I’m making this up but it's not wrong if having lasting relationships with them will give you competitive advantages). Inconsistent suppliers can kill your business as you fail to deliver the product. Also, their product certifications are important, as are not using harmful parts, chemicals, or volatile elements (like heat or water), or mere use. Somebody, please think about the children! Some suppliers require orders to be made even months before your actual need for the materials, so be smart about how you manage the relationship with your suppliers. Consumable products like makeup, edibles, and so on may require extra health certifications. Please check your local regulations. Suppliers may educate you on them if you’re lost here.
- Price rate exchanges if dealing with international suppliers.
- Production capability. 80 to 100% plant productivity is ideal. Implement just-in-time production practices to optimize the use of raw materials and minimize storage needs. The longer a finished product sits on the shelf, the less valuable it is becoming.
- Capital expenditure (CapEx) requirements and cycles to manufacture the product. There’s a reason why car manufacturing is mostly bad business. Car manufacturers need to modernize machinery not because it gets used up, but because car design and practices change frequently. Businesses that have products that change little over time have better economics. Consider also the cycles in which you need to renovate your assets, like retiring old trucks for new ones.
  Variable costs and the elasticity of this variability (like some products being inconsistently more expensive to make than others). Sometimes a product cost varies from plant to plant, or by supplier, or by the talent making it. There’s a bad good example of a CEO that sweeps the floor. Their time isn’t billed by their ability to sweep floors, and even if they have good intentions, they’re a hell of an expensive sweeper for the company.
- Talent and labor. Talent needs to be trained and nurtured. People like to feel appreciated and part of a bigger plan. Labor needs to be paid enough, and all labor processes need to be safe and productivity-prone. What a business does to attract and retain talent varies, but it’s important to always be open to capable or better talent.
  Managerial costs like supervision, inventory controls, warehousing. The larger the business is, the more important this part becomes. It’s crucial to have controls and counts of materials and products to avoid constant petty theft. Also, people need to be sometimes guided, given feedback, and checked by someone looking from above, a supervisor.
- Legal costs, like permits, patents, trademarks, and licensing.
  Planned obsolescence. This may be one of the bigger incentives for innovation. The more a product somehow changes gradually over time, the more appealing the current iteration becomes. However, many businesses convey obsolescence and morally questionable practices, such as not producing replacement parts or servicing of older models, among many other ways to force older products out of circulation.
- Packaging and shelf life. Packaging is not only important for aesthetics and having sustainable packaging materials, but also for transport without damaging the product, being easily stackable, carrying weight (as other stuff may probably be put on it), and being resistant to weather elements, including retaining heat or cold when necessary.
  Guarantees and warranties. Guarantees often make a good incentive to buy. Guarantees talk about the quality standard in which a product will be delivered. They need to be distinct somehow to have appeal.
  A warranty is a contract of service guarantees. A lot of products are marketed hiding much of their warranties, and they even limit them. While limiting warranties, like not covering frequently replaceable parts, can be okay, what is being warrantied is good to have long-term warranties. Many businesses adopt the “lifetime” warranty, or 5 years or 10 years, or more. It’s okay if your product doesn’t have a strong warranty if it gets its appeal elsewhere, like design or construction.

Good products are essential to be competitive in a market. Especially in a competitive market. Apple wouldn’t be Apple if not for its elegant designs that contrast with the ordinary Windows PC. Even with mediocre promotion, good products can win market share and be profitable. They’re the very first step of what makes an enduring and successful business.

Some companies are said to be “product-centric companies,” like Apple, which knows the field so well that they have been able to innovate many times successfully, introducing some groundbreaking products: iMac, iPod, iPhone, iTunes Store, and more recently, Apple Vision.

Product-centric companies often make well-made products because they’re thoroughly focused on them over time. Think Samsung and Xiaomi also. Think of that bakery that has been a classic in your city for the last 50 years. Think about being that expert plumber that knows exactly how to best solve a problem in any circumstance. Companies that boast longevity are often product-centric companies. Think of a tool-making manufacturer that made the most resilient heavy-duty tools that construction workers rely on all day long.

## Place

“Place” is how we say “market” with a P. As a counterpart, or also a complement to the “product-based company,” is the “customer-centric company.” Frankly, it’s harder to think of customers or clients than products. But going out selling a product without knowing who to sell it to is simply bad.

Many times, the entrepreneur is lucky enough to make a product they would consume themselves, and thus the market is easy to grasp. It’s just more people like themselves. But many times, the entrepreneur doesn’t have any idea who to market to, and probably not even a what (a product).

Remember the remarks I listed in “The Need for Marketing” chapter? Marketing is trickery! There’s another I like that helps differentiate marketing from sales:

- Marketing is thinking about the customer or client.
- Sales is thinking about the product.

These remarks are far from a formal definition, but they help clarify. In marketing, or “place,” we take both an eagle’s view and a magnifying glass view on where our products are moving, and more importantly, where the buyers are.

There are four philosophies I want you to take from this part.

1. Niches are the way for riches.
2. There is a gold, silver, and bronze-coin market.
3. The market is where convenience exists.
4. There are multi-dimensional markets.

## Niches are the way for riches.

Unless you’re very innovative, chances are that a market is already somewhat saturated with suppliers, and buyers are flooded with ads and offers. The easiest and most logical step for them is to ignore you. We can call this survival nature. If people really looked or listened to all ads, they’d go crazy and almost never have time in their heads for their own interests.

A clever way to go around this problem is to choose your audience carefully. Focus on the one thing the audience still wants or needs. This one thing can be all over the place. It may be a part of the audience that isn’t really listened to. It may be a specific use-case for a product that the common offerings don’t satisfy. It may be a style or philosophy around a business category that simply doesn’t exist yet and would be desirable. For instance, I don’t like the business networking category overall. It’s dry, and a platform that somehow enables you to easily find and connect with what you need while having some protection from fraud would probably be disrupting in this area.

Focus is the name of the niche game. Spend time with people and see how they behave, consume, what they complain about, and what prevalent problems could still be better solved than with current solutions. See their online reviews on various online platforms, the relevant content they care to create on TikTok, and have plenty of chats in interest groups on whatever social media or forums they use.

There is a gold, silver, and bronze-coin market.

Not all markets are equal. There’s a reason why capitalist migration exists. Say you’re a gardener looking for nice gardens to detail. Would you rather get very small gardens that won’t pay you more than $8 an hour or a big garden that will pay you about $12 an hour? Think of this not only out of money-greed but also effort in how many clients you’d need to make, say, $500, considering the costs of going to many gardens around a borough.

At $8 an hour, you’d need to work 63 hours to make $500. At $12, 42 hours. Say you can do a big garden in 3 hours and a small garden in 1.5. This means that in 42 hours, you are working in 14 gardens in the high-end and 42 gardens in the low-end. That’s more than twice!

The jump between $8 and $12 an hour may not seem too big at first glance, but you can easily see how it quickly compounds. This also says something about giving discounts. Even if they’re small, the money you stop making also compounds quickly. Discounts aren’t bad inherently, but giving them too frequently and without even being asked for them is simply bad business.

Consider the time and extra gasoline you need to get to 42 gardens compared to only 14, including wasted time in traffic. The value of gold-coin markets is evident. But it would be too easy just to say to focus on that. We already talked about the importance of a good product; in this case, your gardening service. If you want to charge the $12 assuming the high end, you need to make sure that your service is worth that.

Silver-coin markets are okay too, but try to pair it with a gold-coin market for best results. In other words, go where the money is.

The market is where convenience exists.

Convenience plays a big part in doing business. Why do you think Netflix killed Blockbuster? Why did the cameras in smartphones give a hit even to digital cameras? The easy, low-hanging fruit, immediate pill is what sells.

Think medicine. Do more people go to check-ups before something bad happens, or do they go until something really hurts? And then, what do they want? To be fixed with pills and move on. This is convenience. Having a problem and getting a pill for it. A fix.

Buyers don’t just want good products and services. They want them to be bought and consumed in a convenient way. That’s why brands do whatever they do to make the products easy to find, pay, use, store, replace, and sometimes, even fix.

There has been the occasional business website that sells the hell out of a product, never to say where or how to buy it. Many times, I’ve found myself wanting a product I simply don’t know how to buy. Right there, we find a broken process.

As a business owner and marketer, you need to put yourself in the shoes of the buyer. Maybe your buying process is obvious to you, but not to them. Be precise on the details on how to buy. “Click the yellow button below to add the product to your basket and continue browsing, or the red button to buy it now. You’ll go directly to the shipping page.”

You may believe that the economy is worse than it looks when you have people buying chewing gum in monthly payments (and that is indeed not good economy-wise), but that also adds to the convenience. Typically, buyers like having several options to pay, including some familiar ones when your online store isn’t well known.

Social media also likes convenience and enables people to buy right from there. We can argue that they want a piece of the action. It’s not dumb having them charge their own small fees to the hundreds of thousands or even millions of businesses that are already marketing there.

Convenience is also distribution. Keeping the product close to the end user adds to the speed of delivery, availability, and less uncertainty (as in imported products may have unexpected taxation or delivery delays). Convenience stores get the name because of the closeness to the end-user and now also because of the mix of services they provide. In Mexico, my country, they’re like small banks too that sell their own debit cards and allow making money transactions there.

The market is wherever money gets exchanged for goods and services.

There are multi-dimensional markets.

This sounds more complex than it really is. A normal business has its own customers where the transactions flow in only one direction. It’s one-dimensional. Other innovative businesses allow having their own middlemen, creating a bi-dimensional market, like Uber. Uber serves the passenger but also the driver.

This is an innovation of the idea of a marketplace. A marketplace allows sellers to sell and buyers to connect to those sellers. Uber “niched out” a marketplace so they control the sellers and the passengers through their app.

Think cars. You can either buy new or used. There’s the new market and the used market. The used market is also referred to as a secondary market or aftermarket. Secondary markets can even make more money than the primary market because used products usually have less taxation and regulations upon them. If a car brand allowed their users to re-sell their cars through their platforms, they could potentially get a piece of a really big pie. This is just an idea to convey how a multi-dimensional market could be created; I’m not suggesting this be done, although if you see the idea viable and can try it, please do.

Usually, a car manufacturer only cares about manufacturing, not about secondary markets. However, they do, at least in selling spare parts. Recognizing the reality that a market tends to be vaster and richer than a simple glance can see will help you reach your audience at the best place. Even the right place in their minds.

## Promotion

Taking off where “Place” left, you don’t only want to reach them physically but also psychologically. That’s what promotion is. Promotion is all about positioning, nurturing, and selling.

### Positioning

Positioning is about how a consumer perceives you and your product. It’s the first thing that pops up in our head when we see brands like McDonald's, Tesla, or Corona. Or with a product like the Harry Potter books, some Star Wars movie, or a bag of Kirkland raisins, Costco’s own brand.

It’s likely that your brand and product isn’t this well recognized, so there’s a challenge for you. How do you correctly position your product not only so people know what it is about but also accept its value proposition, including the quality you are pricing for?

This is where the senses come into play. Sight is the most important, but try not to ignore others when possible, like touch, smell, and ear.

A luxury product like a handbag not only looks nice but also has a nice touch and smell. Premium jeans not only may look business casual but also have a soft feel and not be too hot in heated weather (jeans often retain heat). Car manufacturers not only give a pristine clean car when buying new but they also add the smell (which isn’t natural by the way). Luxury cars also carefully design their noises, like softening the roar of the engine or even isolating the interiors from all exterior sounds when all windows are closed.

Starbucks famously adds a coffee smell to their cafeterias. It isn’t natural, but it is cozy.

How our senses relate to a product or brand helps craft a persuasive message that makes the consumer understand the product quality and thus accept its price. We can easily go beyond our senses and translate those into experiences in our copywriting. We can roughly define an experience as senses plus a story.

There are many considerations in positioning a product or brand. Common sense guides us here. Consumers will inevitably compare your brand and products with others, or even a whole different gamut of substitute products. They will factor their own experiences against your offerings, including good and bad experiences they have had with them, rival products, or even no product at all. Say hiring an accountant versus doing your own tax calculations. All of these factors you yourself have experienced when interacting with countless products and brands over your lifetime. Just be conscious about it.

### Nurturing

Not all sales can happen immediately after a consumer watches an ad or enters your store. Sometimes there are well-known buying processes that involve some kind of qualification. Or sometimes the buyer isn’t free to buy right now. They need a current product or service to expire to replace it. It is important in this case not to let the potential buyer forget about you and decide to renew.

Nurturing is about knowing what the buying context is and offering some risk reversal or easing up the process into your offerings by educating the consumer on what’s best to buy considering the relevant factors.

Typical nurturing content includes buying guides, brochures, catalogs, case studies, books, magazines, and all other educating content that helps bridge your brand and offerings to the needs and desires of your potential consumers.

### Selling

There is an intellectual debate that separates two types of sellers. Those who sell a solution and those who sell a result. One could argue that a solution is similar to a result, but bear with me.

What do you think is better, selling a solution or a result? Even from my early days in direct response advertising, I quickly learned that the ideal was selling a result. So, what’s a result, and a solution, pertaining to selling?

A solution opposes a problem. Or a solution “cancels” a problem, either temporarily or permanently. This is similar to a result, but the difference is that the solution is frequently thought of as a product plus some convenience. You want a big screen at home but don’t have a budget for a 100-inch TV? The solution: a projector. It’s cheaper than a large high-quality TV and can even project 200 inches or more, with the convenience that you can also pay it in installments if it’s still a bit too rich for you.

In sales, the solution is thought of as the product, a sum of features, that helps solve a concrete problem. In principle, there’s nothing wrong with it, but there is one caveat. Solutions often don’t close sales. People may engage with the solution and entertain it, but then move on, considering other solutions. Solutions tend to be more cerebral and logically they make a lot of sense.

But sales aren’t only about logic. You need to engage emotionally too. Our brains react much faster to emotions than to logic. Our logic is always seeking reasons not to buy, not to compromise. One could argue that logic is somewhat tied to fear or aversion to change by default.

Our emotions are what move us to engage in some adventure, take some risk, and do something out of the ordinary. That’s why love is portrayed more as an emotion than an argument. If love was showcased as an argument that must be won by logic and being sensical, you remove all surprise, excitement, getting into the unknown that love usually is associated with, emotionally.

Results include solutions, but they also take the buyer into “an adventure,” even simply by imagination. By visualizing how life is before the problem is solved and the resulting life after the problem is solved. That’s why brands are often separated from products. Brands are human-like, life-like. Products are mechanical, consumables. We can associate with brands much easier because they may reflect some values we care about.

Selling a solution involves listing the features and benefits a product offers to its user. Selling a result involves going further and showing how a product leads to a result that makes our lives better. Even from a simple sponge that saves us five minutes washing dishes that translate into five more minutes of doing something more enjoyable, to estate planning that solves all legal, tax, and any other issues related to passing on assets to the next generation like a mogul.

Take a tent put in the outdoors. If you put a picture of the tent in the ground, you’re showing the solution: a tent is the right product to go camping. Now visualize the picture taken from the inside in the perspective of you lying down inside with your feet sticking outside and a nice natural landscape in the background. That’s the result.

## Price

Pricing is the last key marketing practice that pivots the perception of the offering. There are three parts of pricing to understand the core thinking around pricing.

First, pricing must make business sense. However, you are positioning your company and product in the mind of the consumer; pricing should be set according to that perception. For instance, having a premium quality product that costs only 10% more than a basic option can make buyers doubt the quality of the materials, assembly, or durability of the product. There’s a list of prices you can research for every category that goes from the cheapest options to the most expensive ones. When comparing each offering, quality and differentiators should become apparent.

Second, pricing should be aligned with the business plan. There are several pricing strategies that help introduce products to the market, prime for subsequent purchases, or set up secondary sales. A clear example is ink-based printers. These printers are often cheap, even if they’re premium quality, because the business is on the ink-replacement cartridges. Also, the first month free that Netflix or Amazon’s Prime Video offers is because they’ll make a profit later as the user stays and pays their monthly subscriptions.

Third, pricing should be sensitive to demand. As business owners that take some risk to make our endeavors succeed, we can’t afford to work like a government agency that prices regardless of the market trends, demand, or product stage. If the market is dry, lowering prices is a must. If the market is flooded, raising prices is in the cards. However, be careful of being perceived as a usurer, of exploiting the opportunity to the max regardless of the ethics, as it can damage loyalty or create the wrong perceptions towards your brand.

There is no one “best-for-all” pricing formula. There is only the price that maximizes sales, the price that kills sales, and everything in between. It is part art and science. You can measure how different prices convert, but you can also affect price perception through positioning, persuasion, and selling practices.
