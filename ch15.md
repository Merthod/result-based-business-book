# Marketing 202: From Marketing Process to Funnels

If you have searched the web about marketing funnels, you have probably been confused by (1) the many types or variations there are of them and (2) how to land in practical terms what to do at each step.

A marketing funnel is a concrete representation of a marketing process, made concrete by specifying the tools and their features you’re using. Notice I said “a marketing process.” It’s easy to have many processes, many of which may meet at some point.

Say you are doing Facebook ads and TikTok videos. Both funnels may direct to the same battle-tested landing page, and then you add your email traffic from your newsletters.

Say you have a sales page for your own product that converts very well; then you may introduce an affiliate program to let other marketers promote your product to their audiences for a cut. You have your own funnels that come from Facebook Ads, YouTube ads, TikTok videos, and search engine optimization, and the affiliates have their own funnels that eventually direct traffic to your sales page.

The marketing funnel is usually represented by some arbitrary stages of awareness, from cold to hot, and the people that transit through them are called leads. Saying you have a lead means you can reach them within your funnel in some way, like being an email subscriber.

Depending on the nature of your business, the marketing funnel takes its form. If your business has a complex sales process, you may need to qualify and warm up the cold leads you’re fishing for in the wild. A complex sale means it’s difficult to buy even if they wanted to because there are requirements to be defined, such as in any custom intangible product done through some project management endeavor. These kinds of funnels are often managed through some sort of Customer Relationship Management software (CRM) where there are a combination of automatic data gathering through landing pages and annotations from salespeople and service representatives (with their respective metrics). They might also add a calendar to schedule follow-ups, service calls, or any other kind of contact, such as invitations to events, special sales, and promotions.

If the business doesn’t have a complex sales process that requires a sales representative and it’s much more automatic, such as Amazon’s or Netflix’s way to sell, the funnel is completely driven by tools, helped by persuasive copywriting and offer crafting that pulls strongly toward a sale. Depending on the price point of your offers, the funnel may be more or less elaborate. Commonly, high-ticket offerings are tied to webinars, video sales pages, and other kinds of long-form landing pages, just like the ones you may see at Apple or Samsung for their flagship products. Lower-priced products get away with sales pages, product pages, advertorials, listicles, and solution-centric homepages such as the one at stopyourdivorce.com we saw long ago.

Just to make it clear what these pages are and then some:

- **Landing page:** A simple, short web page that introduces a lead magnet and an email form.
- **Lead magnet:** A piece of content that is magnetic in the way that it is desirable because it helps the user in their buying cycle. It may be a buying guide, a case study, tips and tricks to buy smarter, or even a tool they can use or download.
- **Long-form landing page:** As the name indicates, it’s a scrollable landing page that sells the lead magnet hard. It’s more often used for complex sales that need elaboration on what the benefits of the lead magnet are or is asking for a larger commitment, like an appointment, so you elaborate on your working process to the user.

  **Note:** If using a video sales page, check your analytics closely to see if people aren’t really engaging with it on mobile. Video tends to perform better than text, but if your target audience wants to save on mobile data or network connections are flaky, they won’t work well. Also, check that your videos are optimized for the web and the player can change throughput automatically (up to a legible minimum) depending on the device resolution and connection speed.

- **Home page:** The main page of the website. An effective home page may take the form of another type of page, such as a long-form landing page or a sales page. If it’s a long-form landing page, you might (just might) add some fireworks to the page, such as scrollable animations. Be wary if you use videos to not automatically play them if you are receiving a significant amount of direct traffic since they may be annoying to autoplay on the home page.
- **Listicle:** A made-up word that combines “list” and “article.” They’re great for listing your offerings or sharing affiliate links to other people’s offerings to get a commission. Lists are a highly popular format for content, so you should have some of them in your blog or pages.
- **Advertorial:** Usually pushed through paid advertising, an advertorial is a page that looks like a genuine magazine or publication that soft-sells a product. The content is magazine-like and it usually uncovers it through its history, features & benefits, and proof, asking for the sale at the end, and many soft-sell links all around. Many advertorial pages add fake comment sections that are really testimonials and fake magazine-like menus that don’t do anything to navigate away.
- **Soft-sell link:** A hard sell would be a link that says “buy it now” or “buy it here,” a soft sell link, you put a benefit or hook in a link “you can get 5 for the price of 3” or “while it is still available.”
- **Product page:** A page focused on a specific product, its variants. It includes pictures, videos, description, specifications, and its reviews.
- **Promotion page:** A page focused on presenting time-based promos or special deals (like volume-based discounts). It’s not that common to see them, but they can do wonders if your business benefits from having deals all the time. A variant of a promotion page is the page that presents flash sales, or a Groupon-like page.
- **Long-form product page:** Similar to a product page, but it is like the home page described above, just focused on a product.
- **Quiz lead magnet:** Quizzes are great to bump your subscribers and I suggest having at least one. It can help you qualify, it can give bragging rights, or be just for fun. Similar to any other lead magnet, it’s tied to the user entering their email or some other type of contact information. If you’re asking for the email before giving results, consider giving some results and ask for the email for more insights so it isn’t annoying. Test, as always.
- **Tool lead magnet:** A tool is a great way to bring usefulness while getting leads wanting to do something better. It can be a tool they can use right then and there, an app, an Excel template, or any other kind of useful tool that’s consumed digitally.

## Marketing Funnels are Data Mines

As we defined before, in marketing you want to talk about the buyer, their situation, problems, and opportunities (like elevating their status through a luxurious pen made by a family of artisans). In sales, we focus on the offer itself, or product.

Since a marketing funnel is created digitally, it’s normal to mine data from it to see what’s working and what is not.

Say you have five landing pages with about 10,000 visitors per month each, but they only convert 1%, 4%, 3%, 19%, and 12%. What can you learn?

Maybe focusing on the top two or three winners may help get more leads. There also might be a chance to improve the third landing page or try a new one.

But more importantly, they only give us lead insights, and we can’t eat leads. This is only part of the story. If we tie it to a goal, for them to buy something, then we might learn something else.

Imagine that the 19%-conversion landing page (A) converts only 3% while the 4% landing page (B) converts 79%.

Let’s put numbers to it to understand it.

We receive 10k visitors per month on each, meaning that page A gets 1,900 leads while page B gets us 400 leads. But then we add the dimension of sales. Page A converts only 3%, or 57 leads, while page B converts 316. That is more than five times more sales from a page that gets much fewer leads!

It’s critical for you to get the whole story from your funnels, and don’t bias yourself with a partial story. Page A looks so promising at first sight that it would be easy to stop promoting Page B without giving it a second look. Only after we saw the slump of sales, we’d notice we did something wrong.

Marketing funnels have something called cohorts. A cohort helps us understand the traffic going through our funnels better. Say your funnel receives direct traffic through your TikTok profile link, Instagram ads, and TikTok ads. You have three cohorts. They can get more complex if you have a complex funnel, like tying email marketing to it or when calling a sales representative. That’s why a good data-driven person will ask how you reached the representative. Most professional analytics platforms and CRMs help you see your cohorts. A single funnel may have many cohorts, like in this example we have three. Cohorts are time-bounded. So, if we analyzed all sales coming this week, we may find which cohorts perform better. Then it is a matter of doing some standard profit analysis based on cohorts, seeing if there is a trend, weekly in this case.

Funnels should be tested before you invest heavily in them. If putting $100 into it through ads gets some conversion, test some more, and then go all in if you want, with enough certainty you’re investing money, not gambling it. Good marketing funnels are profit-producing marketing machines. A great funnel may catapult your business to the stratosphere.

## Consider All Your Events and Hooks

Since a marketing funnel is data-driven and based on tools, you should be able to hook new funnel routes whenever a lead is getting cold.

A great funnel can warm leads efficiently into buyers. But not every person buys. Some will leave the site after seeing the product, or after adding it to the shopping cart, or on the payment page, leaving the sales process unclosed.

Your marketing funnel may use this data to reach them, through ads, emails, or messages, to get them to finish the purchase. If they still don’t buy after a few days, you might push a downsell.

Even if the sale is closed, that is also a hook to promote some more with your thank you page and email, and promoting another product page, landing page, tool, later on.

If your remarketing process didn’t work and the non-buyer didn’t return after a week (most likely a lost sale), you can use ads or email to pull them into another marketing funnel through another lead magnet they might want and keep the marketing machine running.

If you don’t have anything else to promote, then you might promote other people’s products to those unsold leads. You may also ask after a while “are you still interested in X?” in an email and wait for their response.

It is advisable to remove all leads after a cool-off period you define, like a month or a couple, since there’s very little chance they will buy. This way you also keep your lists clean and healthy, filled with people who did take action and respond. This audience may have their weight in gold when used with AI through an ads platform to find a similar audience to promote to. If for some reason you don’t want to remove inactive subscribers, you may move them into their own list. Many email marketing platforms allow you to automate this kind of behavior.

Speaking about email marketing platforms, be sure to check several out regarding the kind of business you are building. There are a few platforms targeted for e-commerce that seamlessly integrate with your e-commerce platform so you can automate email sends based on several triggers, like abandoned carts, or adding an item to a cart, thank you for your purchase emails, and so on.

The marketing funnel ties into the marketing process through events and hooks. Remember, the marketing funnel is tool-based, whereas the marketing process is the blueprint or design of the customer experience based on the journey they go from complete strangers to repeated buyers who know, like, and trust your brand. And with brand, I mean the experience of dealing with your company.

Let us get clear what an event and hook is funnel-wise.

- **Event:** An event is a goal that triggers some action, like sending an email or an SMS message. They may be an opt-in (they put their email and clicked subscribe button), a sale, attending a webinar, or being cold (unresponsive) for 14 days.
- **Hook:** A hook are actions that are bound to events. Depending on the tools we are using, we may classify them into the RFM model: recency, frequency, and monetary value. For instance, a hook may trigger an action after a sale is made, if a sale is above $100 USD, or for visitors who constantly open our emails.

Both events and hooks can trigger new funnels. For instance, if a buyer spends more than $1,000 (optional: monthly), they could be invited to a VIP membership (a whole new funnel).

## Funnelception!

You may classify your funnels based on the offerings they are pulling leads into as tripwire funnels, principal funnels, and other custom deeper funnels.

Funnels may be related to each other as the ones introducing leads to each other.

For instance, a tripwire funnel is an introductory funnel that offers a low-priced product in order to break the first-sale barrier (trusting in giving you their card information) and also helps introduce your brand with as much impact as possible so you are known, liked, and trusted.

Buyers from a tripwire funnel may then be invited (event trigger) into a principal funnel that introduces a main offering at a regular price, but has a few time-sensitive attractive bonuses (this is called value stacking). It might be a bundle, a single purchase with its upsells, a subscription, and so on.

Now your marketing creativity is tested. You may attach a one-time offer (OTO based on recency as they’ve just bought and are statistically prone to buying more right then and there) into a higher-value offer (deep funnel) or hook into it depending on how much they spent total, or the frequency of purchases.

Custom funnels sometimes don’t need to start with cold audiences but with an invitation based on the purchase of another offer, call it a warm opt-in as you already have their contact information and know they have just bought from you.

The key here is thinking about funnels since they help get customers and keep them engaged.

Your funnel may acquire customers by:

- **Event:** An event is a goal that triggers some action, like sending an email or an SMS message. They may be an opt-in (they put their email and clicked subscribe button), a sale, attending a webinar, or being cold (unresponsive) for 14 days.
- **Cold leads from SEO through search.**
- **Paid leads from advertising or influencer campaigns.**
- **Existing buyers.**
- **Existing pre-defined buyers (like buyers who spent over $1,000 in the last 3 months or have a gamification threshold, like “Silver-level buyer”).**
- **Warm community-based leads (like Facebook groups, Discord chats, and so on).**

The difference between hot and cold is defined by the KLT triad: know, like, and trust you.

Usually, we understand that the ones that know you are the ones who know at least what problems you solve and at most your products. The ones who like you are a gamut between people who interact in your favor to repeat customers. And the ones who trust you are the ones already giving you money and giving recommendations.

## Your Marketing Genius

Marketing-wise, instead of thinking of products, think of propositions. And instead of thinking of selling, think of funnels.

Strong propositions are magnets of audiences, even in competitive markets. Focusing on having a strong proposition will serve you better than simply thinking of “how to sell my product.”

Well-designed funnels transform fishing (selling) with a fishing rod to casting a wide net that lets the smallest fish free and only catches the large ones.

A strong promise from a strong proposition will make a funnel much more effective without needing to optimize it early because “it just doesn’t convert.” A strong promise will attract many leads, then you optimize the page if you see a dramatic fall between those visitors to actual buyers.

The fall usually falls into one of these three categories:

1. **Technical issues:** Hard to read (either by its design or text size) or exotic fonts, bad web design (including bad text contrast with background, generic images, too many animations, using sounds), slow loading times, redirect to a not found page from emails (happens more often when a funnel runs for some time and sometimes someone in the future edits the page and the page address, even just fixing a typo), sometimes bad translations. Also checking the funnel looks and loads correctly in various screen sizes and browsers.
2. **The promise and the proposition aren’t coherent to one another:** Sometimes you click on an ad because they promise X and, in the page, you find Y (something different). Let the promises you tell in your ads or other selling content be in resonance with the USP or offer at a first glance (not buried in some place below the scroll line).
3. **The funnel is overwhelming:** Even if the funnel has many steps, they must feel easy and smooth. An entertaining process is never boring. If you make your links hard to see, or ask for too much information, or your quizzes look more like a long-winded marketing survey going all in on their personal information. Also, mechanisms like having a calendar for appointments that doesn’t load properly on small screens or is hard to use. Having many different calls to action instead of just one or one with a few variations. Too many upsells or too many configuration options, or product variations. Asking to create an account (and also asking too much information for that) instead of having the option of a social login or account-less purchase (using the email or WhatsApp number as key for later communications). In some cases, especially corporate, a lack of call-to-action. Just a product page and no further information whatsoever to see how or where to buy it.

Even though it may seem overwhelming to follow too many don’ts for your funnel, the important thing is to get started, keeping things simple and building up and optimizing as the funnel becomes more successful.

**Funnel Hooks**

Not all funnels convert as expected, nor do all sales close at the first try.

Your funnels should have reconnecting points targeted to visitors who exit at some point before the close.

This is done through tracking pixels in ad platforms and CRMs including email marketing services that allow tracking of traffic on your site. This way, you can monitor exactly how people use your site and thus, do the appropriate tracking that allows creating the funnel hooks.

Depending on how deep they reach the funnel, the warmer that lead is.

A lead that exited on the payment page is hotter than one that simply visited a product page.

Thus, you create a targeted remarketing ad, or email.

Some effective hooks are:

- Person visited a product page and stayed on it more than 30 seconds.
- Person added a product to cart.
- Person abandoned the payment page.
- People browsing products and then leave.
- People who registered for a trial or demo but didn’t buy.
- Lead magnet subscribers.
- People who registered to a webinar or event but didn’t buy.
- A quote or proposal (request information of a product or create a tailored offering) request.
- People who completed a survey or test.
- People who opened promotional emails.
- People who didn’t buy the upsell or cross-sell.
- Win-back: General campaigns to reignite cold leads before a time period (like 14, 20, or 30 days).

As you can see, some are easier to automate than others. The more specific the interaction is, the more personalized the follow-up. For instance, if it’s a follow-up for a quote or proposal, then a person sends personalized emails and maybe calls them with the help of a CRM that allows scheduling calls, emails, and keeping some custom notes per prospect from previous conversations. This is known as Account-Based Marketing (ABM) which requires human interaction and the process may be eventually disrupted by AI at some point, but it’s hard to replace the human touch in a personal interaction. At least today AI can help craft opening messages to get the conversation going.

In the more automatable hooks, you target these users in your analytics or ads platforms as people who visited X page, but not Y. For example, if you have a thank you page after they pay, and people visited the payment page but not the thank you page, then you know they didn’t buy.

Remarketing to these “leaked” leads can improve your sales significantly to about 30% on average. As always, model what works (at least for you) that you see others do and test variations. A single failed test doesn’t necessarily mean that the idea was bad. Marketing is science in the sense that you need to test ideas until it doesn’t make sense to continue or it works, assuming that your testing hypotheses are grounded.

In your ads, messages, or emails, you can schedule different ones as the lead gets colder, like at 1 day, 3 days, 7 days. This means, for example, that you show one ad from day 1 to day 2, then at day 3 show another, maybe with an extra small incentive like a bundle offer or free shipping, and after 7 days show another with other products that may be related to the one that they didn’t buy.

Email marketing is a special beast and so is messaging, but to a lesser extent. With emails, you can program sequences, also known as “drip email sequences,” meaning one email per X time, like an email a day, for 7 days or 14 days with a few gap days, to warm a lead and program a launching sequence to elevate curiosity and desire. In such sequences, you focus on one detail like elaboration or who makes the product, giving minimum info about the product until the “launch day.”

If the prospect already knows the product, you can tell a story about the product, then the next day a testimonial, the next day some social proof and more information about the product’s key benefits or WOW Factors.

Funnels take the goals and USPs of the marketing processes and turn them into conversion points, also called “micro-conversions” that serve as hooks to position and sell your offerings, and also segment your audiences into marketable interests (i.e., email lists), filter them through qualification processes, analytics (understand them more as their geographical origin, what devices they use), and hooks that allow maximizing sales by continuing some kind of contact with those who interact in some way with your ads and content.

Let us dive a little deeper now into how to maximize sales further in the next chapter.
