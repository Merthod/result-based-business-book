Welcome!

This is the third book on a trilogy I wrote about how normal businesses grow through sales, marketing, acquisitions and other practices.

I'm publishing a free version here for a personal reason that benefits developers like yourself.

## My story

I have worked with many "normal" (not startups) businesses for more than ten years advising them in marketing, commercialization and growth, so I have accumulated a some unique experience and knowledge around it.

I started similar as many of my fellow developers, only that I didn't focus on developing. I started out making and selling websites, only that I sucked at selling them. I shifted my focus from developing to learning sales and marketing skills with top tier personalities, so I became a lot better at selling websites. Only that I did a lot less developing.

I initially made my websites with Drupal, but after learning marketing and selling, I replaced it with WordPress, leveraging their ecosystem to ship sites more quickly. Soon after I changed my focous to advising businesses from all places who were struggling to cross a chasm of having a struggling business to a successful business. I'm talking all kinds of businesses in many industries, from cleaning chemicals, to pet products, studying assistance, to street style fashion to HR consulting to site planning and many more.

Along with my advising business, I started writing books in both English and Spanish.

So I became mostly an amateur JS developer, and like to help other struggling beginning and intermediate developers with some code to get them unstuck in their apps.

## Your case?

You probably have had some experience similar to the developers I have helped, too.

Some had a IaaS to easily launch an app from code with a minimal need to know DevOps. Others developed a WordPress plugin and don't know how much to charge for it. Many others use their developer skills to help their family businesses, maybe by making an app, an online store, or simply some auxuliary software to manage inventory, orders or some other tool that makes the operations a bit easier.

Similarly to when I started out, I find many developers aspiring to building a business to have zero business sense and when they look for help, they find a lot of shiny objects, meaning startup sizzle.

The dream of having a highly scalable business from a garage that attracts million-dollar investments, with so many people enthusiastic about that derail the more typical entrepreneur to dream big and adopt a "philosophy" of failing often and better. At the end it's all a learning experience, isn't it? Only an expensive one.

So many discussions I have had with developers clueless about business is that they either really don't know anything about businesses (the majority) or like to use startup buzzwords with a misguided purpose.

In this sense, many developers make products yet to find an an audience that gets enthusiastic about them. I've seen a robot that makes (questionable) pizzas that got a lot of funding, to making a (X)aaS (anything as a service) out of everything you can think of. This is mostly the Silicon Valley bubble, that makes little sense outside of it.

## This is why this book is here

This book helps developers develop a keen business sense, so they can act in the activities that move the needle forward.

In a more general way, it helps whoever is struggling with their business focus their effort in result-making activities.

This is a book that reveals some ugly truths about their environments and the resources to make it the business world. Sometimes I feel it's controversial, but it is all based on real experiences from myself and many other successful entrepreneurs, investors and some historic events.

It's about you discovering what matters than don't waste any resources in what not, to make it in your business.

## What this book is

This is a book to learn how business work and become a sort of machine by themselve through processes and systems.

You'll learn mostly about results-based marketing, namely some direct-response principles and others to successfully launch and manage a marketing process.

You'll learn how to create a process for innovation, so it impacts the business positively in the long-term without relying in some one time inspiration for a revolutionary product.

You'll learn how to organically grow your business through sales and other simple financing options.

You'll learn about leadership and stewardship of the business model so it can capture the most value possible.

You'll develop your own intangible capital that strengthens your brand and its goodwill.

You'll see some finance fundamentals so you manage your business like a seasoned CEO.

You'll bootstrap some fundamental skills that will help you open doors for yourself through the power of words and persuasion.

You'll be challenged to question and discover your own truths, so you trust your new business instincts and doubt whatever shiny objects are put in front of you.

You'll understand the difference of being opportunitistic and systematic in your actions, and when to use each.

## What this book is not

This is not a book for who wants to follow the startup path of high risks and high rewards, although the knowledge from this book is still relevant to you if you want to improve your odds.

This is not a book on business recipes that pushes some tool to "make it work".

This is not a get rich quick scheme nor some questionable business model like network marketing promoting book.

This is not a book on how to get investors. Many of uss living outside the startup world find it harder to get financing other than fool's money (family, friends and any fool that believes your idea).
