# 12. Communicating Effectively

Effective communication ensures your message is understood. It generates interest, excitement, and agreement, which is the essence of persuasion. While we focus on writing here, these principles apply to other forms of communication, such as speeches, songs, and films.

Our journey begins in Ancient Greece with Aristotle, who once tutored Alexander the Great. When asked why he charged high fees, Aristotle responded, "Because I aim to make him worthy of his royal birth." Years later, Alexander, then a powerful military leader, requested new knowledge from Aristotle. Upon receiving a shipment of books, Alexander found them incomprehensible without his teacher's guidance and returned them, asking for teachers instead.

Aristotle's work on rhetoric is crucial for democracy, enabling people to deliberate, reason, and debate complex issues. Without rhetoric, decisions would be based on emotion and prejudice rather than reason and evidence. Aristotle introduced the Three Modes of Persuasion: **Ethos**, **Pathos**, and **Logos**.

- **Ethos** refers to the speaker's character and credibility. It answers the question, "Why should I believe you?"
- **Pathos** refers to the audience's emotional state. It addresses the audience's beliefs, threats, and opportunities.
- **Logos** refers to the logic of the argument. It answers the question, "Why is this argument true?"

People integrate emotion into their reasoning. To be effective, your pitch must appeal to both logic and emotion.

**The Big Idea and Benefits**

- "The more facts you tell, the more you sell."
- Facts lead to features, which lead to benefits, answering "Why should I care about this feature?"
- Benefits should be based on the product's features, not adjectives.
- Benefits help people understand the facts easily, removing guesswork and logic puzzles.

### The WOW Factor

The WOW Factor highlights the benefits others gain from the buyer's use of the product. It can be understood as "benefits from the benefits." For example, a book might offer amazing investment ideas, but its WOW Factor is that it uses the same analysis employed by super-investors like Warren Buffett.

### The Reason Why

Providing a reason why makes your argument more compelling. For example:

_Original_: Steal this deal—50% off.

_Improved_: Steal this deal—50% off. Why this crazy discount? I need to clear the warehouse for new stock. Act now, as this deal won't be available again.

Asking "why" helps understand the product's existence and the market's mentality. Great businesses often succeed by challenging the status quo.

### KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid

Great copywriting is never complex, jargonized, or self-centered. Focus on the reader's self-interest and use simple language. Imagine reading a piece titled "The Real Truth About [Your Name]"—it's engaging because it's about you. Keep sentences and paragraphs short, and use power words and transitional words to maintain flow.

### Should copy be short or long?

Long copy is usually preferred, depending on the media and the message. Don't worry about length; worry about being boring.

### Use AI

AI can help simplify text, generate headline ideas, restructure copy, or outline a sales page. However, it may have a recognizable flow and unproven sales potential. Use AI as a starting point and build upon its output.

### Deep Desires

Understanding your audience's deep desires makes them feel you're reading their mind. Copywriters often use lists of deep desires, such as the Seven Deadly Sins and their Virtues, or Clayton Makepeace's 16 dominant emotions. To identify these desires, look for unsaid frustrations in product reviews, interviews, or related videos.

Capitalism is the economical science of showcasing pleasure for one side of the coin, and hiding pain on the other.
Rich countries like to boast their abundance. They have restaurants with the biggest and greasiest burgers. They buy a lot more clothing than needed just to accommodate to a trend and style. They build the loudest and fastest car engines with luxurious leather in their seats. They enjoy a large house with dozens of amenities and comforts.

Poor countries that serve the rich countries hide their poverty, pollution and exploitation often through an iron hand, corrupt government and international media that underreports what’s happening. Rich countries often look the other way. We are all guilty of this and this fits capitalism, because we all become part of the problem and that makes it much easier to just ignore it. We as privileged people can’t really imagine how many people live without running water, or even without faucets and wall or ceiling mounted showers with hot water on demand.

What’s alluring of capitalism is the promise of wealth and comfort through a stable job, investing or entrepreneurship. But what most people see as the path to be rich? Winning the lottery. Street surveys often shows that the everyday people can only grasp being rich through a lucky break through the lottery ticket.

So, enter the Seven Deadly Sins. These Sins represent the imbalance of behavior towards self-aggrandizing. They are all signs of a big ego. They are also show Darwinian economics and politics really work because it defines its own “survival of fittest” perspective, from being the better looking, the most cunning or simply afford a lazy luxurious lifestyle. I’ll put the explanation of each sin in an Appendix, since the Deadly Sins as a source of deep desires can get depressing.

In a more friendly perspective, a master copywriter, Clayton Makepeace, shares 16 “dominant emotions” to write for.

Yes, most copywriter calls deep desires by their own name. That’s our thing!

- Anger
- Betrayal
- Revenge
- Fear
- Frustration
- Greed
- Happiness
- Hope
- Love / Caring
- Passion
- Relaxation
- Sadness
- Security
- Shame
- Powerlessness
- Urgency

Using deep desires isn’t like choosing from a coffee shop menu. You need to understand the underlying emotions that make your prospect look for solutions like yours, or would make them look.

Look for product reviews, interview potential buyers or watch videos related to the products to understand what is not told. For instance, when I was a software consultant for a big German ERP that mainly helps manage large manufacturing companies, one common unsaid frustration is how ugly, limited and complex was using that software. When I made the remark, I often saw smiles and some excited yesses. One could say it was a mix of sadness and anger, mainly because we as users were unable to get something better. A way to leverage this for a metaphorical product was to showcase how fun and easy was a software to use and customize. Imagine not needing a certified professional nor learning a specific programming language just to make a custom report on demand.
