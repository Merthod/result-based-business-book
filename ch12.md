# On Value Propositions (and Headlines)

A value proposition is the crux of every marketing process.

A value proposition introduces the offer, where the difference is that many offers may share a value proposition. The classic 60’s headline of Rolls-Royce saying “At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock” promise applies to every model, but they focused on one for the ad.

This value proposition from the headline may have been unique, which makes it much stronger because no other car business could claim the same and show it. Now in our time, this claim may no longer be true because electric vehicles are intrinsically silent, so the uniqueness of the proposition made by the Rolls-Royce advert is lost. They had to find a new unique mechanism which is now around timelessness and style, including extra comfort and top-notch building and bespoke finishing materials. There’s something obviously different in those cars, from just opening the door in an abnormal way, to a starry ceiling and its unique profile that makes it recognizable in the dark by those who know the brand.

### Are Value Propositions Ad Headlines?

They can be, and great copywriters often use them as headlines, with some modifications to make a great headline: unique, useful, curiosity-driven, and timely.

A value proposition is usually general about the offering and usually doesn’t focus on a single distinct element of a product (the unique mechanism). The Rolls-Royce headline did focus on one element because that works best for a headline. The spirit of the value proposition still holds in those words because the headline still conveys that the car is great. Logic says that we can deduce, going from the general to the specific; and also induce, going from the specific to the general. Letting the audience induce that the car is amazing based on a few amazing specific details is a great way to get them to discover that the brand is actually great.

## The Big Idea

Value propositions can be abstracted as “Big Ideas,” which is a concept coined by David Ogilvy. The motivation, quoting David, is: “Most campaigns are too complicated. They reflect a long list of objectives, and try to reconcile the divergent views of too many executives. By attempting to cover too many things, they achieve nothing. Their advertisements look like the minutes of a committee.”

A Big Idea doesn’t have a single best definition because the concept is elusive. So I’ll share some definitions from some great advertising minds:

Now it’s quote time.

_"A big idea is something which has never been said before, or which says something old in a new way... It comes up once in twenty briefs, perhaps even less frequently. When you get a Big Idea, hold onto it tight because it does not happen often."_ – David Ogilvy

_"The unique and valuable proposition that a company offers to its customers."_ – Al Ries and Jack Trout

_“Something provocative and interesting enough that consumers would want to participate in the conversation about it."_ – Geoffrey Frost

_"Three characteristics—originality, profundity, and pertinacity."_ – John Hegarty

Where pertinacity basically means sustainable through time while being relevant.

Propaganda may give us a key to untapping the power of a Big Idea. David Ogilvy wasn’t always a legendary adman. During World War II, he worked for the British Intelligence Service in Canada, alongside Dr. George Gallup (who later created a famous statistical analysis company) where he mastered the art of propaganda. Mr. David Ogilvy was trained in close combat and sabotage, where his missions were about ruining the reputation of businessmen who were industrial suppliers of the Nazis.

David Ogilvy created iconic advertisements including Rolls-Royce, Sears, the British Government, the state of Puerto Rico, Dove, Shell, and many other brands.

He published a book in 1963 called “Confessions of an Advertising Man” where he spilled many of his secrets, including the Big Idea. His Big Ideas showed themselves upon layers of facts, truth, and helpfulness. I’ll summarize all of these to better understand the Big Idea.

### About Facts

- “The more facts you tell, the more you sell.”
- Facts lead to features, and features lead to benefits, which basically answer “why should I care about this feature?”
- Benefits are important, but they are not to be adjectivized; they should simply be based on the facts (features) of the product and its maker.
- They are straight to the point, but the benefit perspective helps people understand the facts easily, removing all guesswork and logic (if your ad makes a person assemble a logical puzzle or think too much, you’ll lose their interest very quickly).
- In the case of headlines, avoid empty headlines that require reading or watching everything else to be able to understand them; most people won’t do the effort.
- Don’t make an advertisement you wouldn’t like your family to read.
- People don’t get bored reading about what they care about. If your product is worth caring about, don’t assume they’ll be bored by its facts.

### About Truthfulness

- Consumers aren’t stupid, and they will catch you if you lie or mislead them.
- Common sense is the best guide for taking ethical decisions through your ads.
- Good products can be sold by honest advertising.
- Avoid superlatives, generalizations, and platitudes (truths that are too well known).
- Avoid bombastic words.

### About Helpfulness

According to Ogilvy, there are two kinds:

1. Helping the prospect understand the product.
2. Giving the prospect valuable information and advice for free.

- The second one is where content marketing is born.
- Content marketing isn’t about you being kind; it’s about making them informed buyers.
- Helpful advice or service will hook about 75% more readers than just stating facts about the product.
- _Include your selling promise in your headline_.
- Every headline should appeal to the reader’s self-interest.
- Don’t give negatives in headlines.
- Don’t try to be smart in your headline (making puns, alliterations, or other obscure literary artifacts).

Data-driven marketers don’t believe in Big Ideas because they favor personalization. Big Ideas are most often used to disrupt a standard idea of how something is done and help position the product as the shortcut for the desired result. One iconic example is the decades-long Snickers chocolate bar Big Idea: “You’re not you when you’re hungry.” Like so, the Snickers bar positions itself as a snack you quickly get when you can’t have lunch. Big Ideas can’t be personalized, but they help position a brand instantly through a well-crafted value proposition. After that, you can pivot from the Big Idea to other personalized value propositions.

AliExpress’s Big Idea is “Better Choices. Better Prices.” This is a great presentation for the overall service, but then they personalize ads through Ads Intelligence: products in the cart, recently visited product pages, and low-stock notices, among many other hooks.

Big Ideas are stronger than slogans because they are value propositions by themselves on why the brand matters and what it is about. Slogans are just inspired ideas that make the owner proud of their business but do little to nothing to help position, and thus, set up the selling stage for what the brand is offering.

Big Ideas also reflect change. They are a reason why the buyer’s world has changed forever. Why is it your Big Idea the future and the present, and how does it conflict with how similar products have worked in the past? What’s the key insight that helps see your offering in this new light said in only a few words?

### How to Come Up with a Big Idea?

As previously stated, the concept is hard to come by, even for expert admen. But if you look long enough, you’ll eventually find some ideas.

First, you need to know the product very well, both physically and functionally.

Second, you need to know the audience very well. See how they use the product and how they understand it. What you’re selling is not necessarily what they’re buying, idea-wise.

Third, understand the environment. Where, how, and why does your offering fit and is relevant in the niche, category, or market?

Fourth, set an objective. What do you want to incentivize with your idea? Awareness, sales, or loyalty? You can develop a few for each to test.

Fifth, use product facts, functionalities, usage research, reviews, market insights, and whatever sources of information you can find to develop ideas, refine them, discard the clear losers, and when you find a winner, use it extensively until it stops working, not until you get bored.

Don’t constrain yourself with time to get a Big Idea. Sometimes it can take months to come up with one. Until you find one, feel free to use other value propositions.

## Different Kinds of Value Propositions

There are unique and non-unique value propositions.

Great marketing stands on the shoulders of unique value propositions.

Unique value propositions are hard to copy, imitate, or emulate.

Like the original McDonald’s unique value proposition, you can probably make a better hamburger, but you couldn’t do it faster and consistently regardless of how many burgers you made. Their value proposition stood on the shoulders of a unique “assembly line” taken into a kitchen.

There is an arbitrary number of value proposition angles. I can easily list five, probably ten if I focus. Others may find the seven “definitive” angles, but it’s preferable to keep an open mind about them, because as you can see, they come from the insides of your business, not from a marketing or business book.

It’s easy to summarize all of the angles into the one iconic “Unique Selling Proposition” or USP. The USP is the answer to an intriguing question: why should the buyer choose you over other direct or indirect alternatives?

But the USP is more easily understood if we dissect a few angles first.

1. System Value Proposition
2. Product Value Proposition
3. Service Value Proposition
4. Experience Value Proposition
5. Risk Reversal
6. Irresistible Offer
7. Network Effect Value Proposition
8. Leadership-based Value Proposition
9. The Mix

Let’s talk briefly about each.

### 1. System Value Proposition

It’s about your processes or your working systems.

If efficiency and efficacy are major selling points, you might consider trademarking your system and giving it a unique name, like the Ritz-Carlton does with their “Gold Standard” service.

### 2. Product Value Proposition

It’s about the uniqueness of a product.

If there’s a patent, product customization, distribution (availability and convenience), or some business economies that enable unique pricing, you might find the USP is about the product itself.

One might consider also the environment that the product creates for itself. For instance, Microsoft Windows is _the_ operating system to have if you love gaming since most PC games run on it.

### 3. Service Value Proposition

It’s about the service around a product offering.

Most businesses lose customers because of bad service. About 7 out of 10 customers that stop buying do it because of this reason alone. Service-value proposition highlights how the business cares about servicing their buyers. From the most personalized luxury-level service to the most efficient self-service. Think of banking in your phone app instead of going to the bank or holding 20-minute calls with a lot of “wait a moment, please” moments.

### 4. Experience Value Proposition

The experience is about setting a mood, or creating a “magic moment,” or being the “go-to” for some reason.

If you’re a romantic in New York with money, you probably would like to get married in the Plaza Hotel. That’s quite an experience. It can be a tourist attraction, or use some quality of the environment you have (or create) to sell the experience.

Think Disneyland, an adult-only Caribbean cruise ship (or family-friendly too, two different experiences), an “authentic” restaurant, luxury, or some place you like to go to have fun dancing, watching sports, meeting people, working on the go comfortably, learning new skills with top pros, and so on. Dating apps offer us the experience of meeting new people, though they’re quite controversial. TikTok and social media.

### 5. Risk Reversal

Also known as “safety value proposition,” but I find Risk Reversal a more appropriate name because that’s the goal of safety. This answers, how to eliminate all risk in your offering?

The answer is you take it for them. You help them set up whatever needs to be set up to enjoy the product. Satisfaction guaranteed is that; the transaction is not closed until the client signs off.

Some companies even take this to the extreme, like safe companies that offer a bounty to whoever breaks it. That’s a testament to its well-thought engineering. Software companies often offer bounties to hackers who find holes, although it sometimes gets controversial when they don’t pay up.

### 6. Irresistible Offer

Marketing is all about offers. Offers are where companies and buyers meet. Irresistible offers improve the value perception to minimize the pain of the price bite.

A lot of psychology plays here. One popular way to create easy and effective Irresistible Offers is by anchoring. Say you want a TV that costs $800 and that price is too expensive by itself. But then the company puts it next to a TV of $2,500. Now the first TV looks cheap.

It also works the other way around.

Say the cheaper TV is $2,200 and the expensive TV is $2,500 with much better features. Only a $300 difference? Then the bite doesn’t hurt from that perspective and we take the more expensive TV.

There are many ways to create perceived value and create an Irresistible Offer, but it’s important to note that as much as gimmicks as these may seem, the most important part of an offer is the product it promotes. Irresistible Offers can work wonders on good products. They won’t rescue mediocre products.

Some popular ways to create Irresistible Offers are:

- Add free bonuses and show how much of a discount the offer is when adding up the face value of these bonuses. Usually, the more the merrier, especially when they’re intangible (no added variable costs). Keep a quality standard; don’t bundle poor bonuses of unsold stuff.
- Add strong guarantees and warranties.
- Add testimonials and/or social proof (how many users, subscribers, or buyers).
- Demonstrate the product.
- Let the buyer test the product risk-free and for free.
- Add credible scarcity and urgency to the offer (limited units, limited bonuses, disappearing offer, and so on).
- Use strong copy that shows how the product works and solves the exact issues you are promising it fixes.
- Use your own story, or user stories.

### 7. Network Effect Value Proposition

Now this sounds like a mouthful, but it summarizes more than a dozen ways you can position your offering.

The main thing is that here we focus on the product as an opportunity.

From brands, exclusive offers for exclusive customers, to belief systems, multidimensional opportunities (like Uber: call a car or make money driving too), marketplaces, status-driven luxury\* or Premium\*\*, a broadcasting channel (think social media too), anything that generates FOMO, expertise (like accounting firms or software), and platforms (like the PlayStation and its games for exclusive and not, or a car brand that has a popular platform so it’s cheap to repair).

- Here we understand luxury as not always scalable but exclusive, sometimes location-based, genuine, and one-of-a-kind product.

\*\* Here we understand Premium as a normal product with economies of scale but with Premium parts.

### 8. Leadership-based Value Proposition

Based on innovation, personal brand, or preemptive marketing.

It’s about positioning yourself or the company as cutting-edge or “the #1” or “first” in the niche. If you aspire to be the sought-after authority in the market, you need to promote your leadership in it. There are several ways to do it. One is showcasing other perceived leaders as clients (brand showcasing), another is establishing influence in some media outlet (even of your creation), interviews, publishing books, sponsorships, organizing events, and being the first one to publish, analyze, or generate news in some topic. We could add public relations here but this opens another Pandora’s Box since PR is about influencing opinion.

### 9. The Ultimate Value Proposition

As stated at the start of this subchapter, value propositions are many and other authors may suggest fewer or more, but usually, they all fall into these eight previously stated categories.

Admittedly, the description of each is not thorough by a mile and many sources of value are still unmentioned. The goal here is not to create an encyclopedic list of value proposition themes, but to see different kinds of value propositions so you can polish your own and add more value as you learn more about them.

This ninth kind is all about that. Many marketers combine two or more kinds of value propositions to create the ultimate USP. One classic example is the original Domino’s Pizza one, “hot fresh pizza in 30 minutes or less or it’s free.” It combines a Product Value Proposition and Risk Reversal. It may not be the greatest pizza, but the guarantee somehow makes it compelling to call for one. That’s the spirit of a USP, to make it compelling to call.

Risk reversal and service together help destroy product returns. That’s why Apple created its “Genius Bar,” not only to service defective or damaged hardware but also to help users use and set up their products and make the most from them. They’re a secondary sales force. This enables Apple to successfully control their complete value chain experience, and thus offer an Ultimate Value Proposition offering based on product, service, system, network effects, risk reversal, and experience. Basically, the whole list to some level. Apple has guided itself through a Big Idea, “Think Different” for at least the most critical years of its rebirth, which compels tech users who like style and are contrarian of the views of the main competitor. This has created hardcore fans for decades now.

### 10. The Others

As we previously stated, there are many sources to create a Unique Value Proposition.

Other unmentioned and lesser-used are:

- **The Distribution Value Proposition**: based on media platforms and content delivery mechanisms.
- **The Strategic Value Proposition**: based on the dominance or mastery of a customer acquisition method. Such as having a “school,” strong media creation strategy, certifications, and so on. This proposition usually has a “us versus them” mentality.
- **The Value Chain Value Proposition**: where the value chain directly impacts customer acquisition, such as drop-shipping, lean manufacturing, or circular economies (recycled-based).
- **The Ideology Value Proposition**: based on a unique perspective of how business should be done or what the near future might be. Think tanks typically fall into this category, since they try to influence life through their own ideas and understanding of society. Also political parties and social groups.
- **The Competitive Value Proposition**: When your offerings are easily comparable, offer more than the competitors. This includes more depth (verticals or specialization) or more product or a wider offering, bundles, strong volume price advantages, trusted source, quality guarantees, and so on. For these propositions to work best, it’s recommended you adopt an extremist perspective on how you will dominate your niche.
- **Gamification**. Arguably, this can also be part of the Experience Value Proposition. However, gamification is a beast in its own right with dozens of strategies that can help create a lot of value for your business. From a simple points system that adds features and bragging rights for the user to using a scoring or challenge-based system that helps a fitness trainer keep a small group motivated. Gamification is also a bit too niche, but if you can adopt some game mechanics, you might generate perceived value in your offering. Especially at these times where people like to measure progress as simply as the steps walked in a day, number of followers, and clout. The Octalysis Framework by Yu-Kai Chou helps identify dozens of gamification strategies.

All of these different kinds of value propositions have the goal of you building your Unique Selling Proposition. They showcase different angles on building perceived value and thus make it compelling to act.

Value propositions don’t necessarily need to become headlines, but they often do. They can transmute into a Big Idea presenting the biggest idea, and then you may have a list of value propositions that serve as sub-headlines or bullet points that continue to build upon the main big idea.

Value propositions need to be communicated, though. They say the next best thing to doing the right thing is saying that you’re doing the right thing. Advertising is such a fundamental task for any business to get its propositions out in the world that it cannot be understated how important it is.

Great communication stems from common sense, and common sense follows a simple millennia-old formula we’ll see next.
