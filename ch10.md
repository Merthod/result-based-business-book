## Product Development

A strong business revolves around a great product. Products can be tangible or intangible. Intangible products are often referred to as services, such as a Tarot reading or a cellphone plan, but they can also include digital products like streamed movies, music files, and more. The key to a successful business is finding or creating profitable products that generate long-term revenue.

Many businesses invest in research and development to ideate, prototype, and test new products. This process includes addressing the legal aspects necessary for a proper launch, such as filing patents and complying with regulations, especially for consumable products like food, beauty, and health items. Additionally, it may involve trademarking the business name and its iconography.

Most small businesses rely on the research and development efforts of larger businesses. For example, the automotive industry created a demand for repairs and aftermarket upgrades. Furthermore, international commerce plays a significant role; many small businesses import Chinese tech products at competitive prices and sell them on their own platforms or third-party platforms like eBay, Amazon, or MercadoLibre in Latin America. Some businesses invest heavily in these projects, even offering warranties for imported products and developing strong commercial relationships with distributors. A popular business model that emerged from this concept is drop-shipping, where you buy directly from the manufacturer and ship directly to the buyer, requiring minimal initial investment. However, drop-shipping can be challenging to scale because you don’t control the logistics.

Big businesses also capitalize on these opportunities. Amazon, for instance, sells its own line of products, albeit with some controversies (such as copying designs for its Amazon Basics brand), and features a direct-from-China section with low-priced products, albeit with longer shipping times.

Competition is now multidirectional. You compete not only with local businesses but also with larger companies with specialized product lines—whether local, regional, or multinational—and sometimes questionable or even illegal business practices. For example, in Mexico, Chinese suppliers openly sell products that lack local regulatory compliance, displacing local businesses.

A common mistake is creating a product based on personal preference without market validation. Developers might build software products that solve unique problems in their work environment, only to find limited external interest. In software development, problems can be unique and unappealing to a broader niche due to the specific tech stack used.

The best approach to product development is similar to finding a good restaurant in an unfamiliar city. Look for the one with a crowd. Basing your product on social proof is a strong strategy. Pre-launches are an effective way to validate demand before the product even exists, much like having people queue up for a promised delicious burger. However, your burger must be interesting and different to attract a growing line.

It's acceptable to start with a personal problem, but also consider who else shares this problem. This reminds me of one of the most effective advertising headlines: "Who Else Wants a Successful Direct-Mail Package?" Although old, this headline is a template used for many products across various industries:

- Who Else Wants an Executive-Level Promotion?
- Who Else Wants Whiter Teeth for a Radiant Smile?
- Who Else Wants an Effective Morning Routine to Start Their Day Right?
- Who Else Wants to Save Money on Groceries Every Week?
- Who Else Wants to Learn Guitar Without Spending Hours Practicing Each Day?
- Who Else Wants to Build Muscle and Burn Fat at Home?
- Who Else Wants to Master Public Speaking and Deliver Powerful Presentations?

Each headline attracts a specific niche and encourages self-qualification. If someone qualifies, they are likely curious and potentially interested in buying the product. Marketing agencies have found that the headline can influence up to 80% of a buying decision, so it's crucial to spend ample time crafting it. Old-school copywriters often spent more time on the headline than on any other part of the sales letter, crafting it last to ensure it encapsulated the letter's essence. With AI, analyzing and extracting great headlines for testing has become easier. However, this doesn't mean relying solely on AI; use it to develop ideas that you can edit, rearrange, and test. Selling retains a strong human element that machines may never fully replicate.

## Selling Yourself on the Product Idea

Years ago, I discovered the Amazon PR/FAQ memo, which I've used for myself and clients to structure product ideas. This memo resembles a letter and can serve as an early draft for a sales letter once you find a promising product.

Outlined in the book "Working Backwards" by Colin Bryar and Bill Carr, this method starts with the customer's needs and works backward to an ideal product or service that delights them.

Here’s an outline of the memo along with some copywriting tips to make it as powerful as possible:

**The Press Release**
This section provides an overview of the problem and its solution.

Define a headline, subtitle (second strongest headline), and date.
Introductory paragraph.
State the problem.
Explain how the product solves the problem.
Include a quote from a company spokesperson.
Describe how the product or service works.
Include a customer quote.
Provide a call to action on how to get started.

**The Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**
Consider questions from buyers:

Quality: Durability, construction, future improvements, production grade, etc.
Price.
Support: Usage assistance, client-side assembly, maintenance.
Target audience: Who the product is for and not for.
Guarantees: What if it’s not for me?
Company background: Who is behind the product.
And from stakeholders:

Profitability: Including distribution partners and licensing.
Market appeal: What niche or market gap does this product fill?
Costs: Optimization strategies.
Barriers to entry: Ease of replication by competitors.
Competitors.
Talent requirements: Specialization or sourcing.
Intellectual capital: Brands, specialized processes, compliance with regulations.
Focus on the most critical questions for your case, as too many assumptions can derail your project.

Include any visuals, diagrams, or wireframes you have.

Finally, share the memo with team members, your target audience, and trusted individuals. Observe their understanding and enthusiasm, especially if they’re potential buyers. If the idea sparks interest and discussion, you might have a basis for a product and can proceed to prototyping.

## The Fateful MVP

The Minimal Viable Product (MVP) is a methodology for developing new products by obtaining the maximum validated learning about customers with minimal effort. It validates assumptions about what customers want, need, or are willing to pay for, without significant upfront investment.

In practical terms, the MVP can be complex. It might involve creating a simple landing page to gauge demand or developing a functional product with key features. The goal is to gather feedback to invest resources wisely.

The challenge with the MVP is its abstract definition of "minimal." Creating a landing page to introduce a product pre-launch is hardly a "product." If you consider a Kickstarter page part of the product, it feels disingenuous. A product is something you can assign a price to. A landing page asking for advance payments is just a promise; the money paid is unrelated to the landing page itself.

The viability aspect of the MVP is also abstract. If you create a reduced product for testing, where do you draw the line between viable and unviable? The features chosen might seem arbitrary. For example, developing a word processor like Microsoft Word—what would be the MVP? A white page that allows typing? But what if users want direct online publishing? Both are valid features for a new product.

Minimize the arbitrary definitions introduced by the generic MVP method and create a Minimal Lovable Product or a Minimal Enjoyable Product. For your initial iteration, develop a simple, complete product. For instance, "the Word Processor that lets you publish directly online." The product can evolve based on feedback.

Many page builders for websites started with a simple promise: helping users design websites without coding. Although initially limited, they became more feature-rich, allowing users to achieve new promises like "develop any type of website without code." Feedback helped, as users wanted reusable components, third-party font integration, and sophisticated user interfaces without coding.

The MVP concept isn't wrong; the interpretation can be confusing. If asked for a Simple Value Proposition, clearly state the main idea behind the product compellingly. In the 70s, Domino’s Pizza would have answered, "hot fresh pizza in less than 30 minutes or it’s free." Its later sophistication involved elevating the business model into a franchise to fulfill the same promise consistently.

A simple product should be complete. If it fails to deliver its promise, nobody will love it, use it, and failure will be foreseeable. From the Simple Value Proposition, you can sell it on a landing page, but remember that’s a promotional and financing strategy, not a product.

## Hiring Clients and Proposition Hypotheses

Until you find a value proposition that attracts business-building demand, your propositions are hypotheses. You’re testing whether your market assumptions generate enough demand.

Create as many propositions as you want, but test one per page or letter. Clarity is key in selling; avoid confusing your audience with multiple promises. Lead with one big promise, and let everything else revolve around it.

After understanding who you are selling to and what you are selling, focus on your niche with a Napoleonic mindset: aim to dominate and let clients see your greatness and find greatness in themselves to maximize the relationship's value.

This can be seen as the reason you are selling to them, but clearer to me is hiring clients.

Assuming you use internet services like social media, email, website hosting, cloud backup, or phone apps for messaging, geolocation, and work-related tasks, you agree to their "terms and conditions." These terms specify how users must behave when using their products and services. Violating these terms voids the contract, allowing the service to block you. This is hiring clients in a nutshell.

Hiring clients involves being specific about who you want to serve and why. It’s more about behavior than demographics. For example, if you sell dog products, you might target a specific breed, but more importantly, you should target people who care for their dogs like family members. Your proposition hypothesis could be, "We serve people who care for their dog as a family member, because we know that not all family is blood-bound and we understand what it means to create good memories with your happy and healthy dog—our products are for people like yourself who want to protect your companion’s health, nature, and beauty."

If clients don’t relate to these values, they aren’t a good fit. They might argue that your pricing isn’t competitive, and they’d be right. They just want a cheap toy and don’t care much about its quality. Don’t be shy about stating who you serve best, but avoid being too specific that you limit growth. Focus on the main traits many clients share.

Qualifying and disqualifying clients is equally important. Clearly state who isn’t a good fit, just as you would for an employee. This ensures that your hired clients care about your messages and offers.

## A Note on the Difference Between Clients and Customers

Not all businesses operate this way.

Many businesses don’t focus on hiring clients; they are more transactional, like a gas station on a remote highway. They cater to situational needs, such as fast shipping, secure payment methods, good product selection, convenience, or pricing. A large e-commerce site comes to mind here.

A client implies loyalty rooted in a relationship. A customer becomes a repeat customer if your proposition is consistent. However, customers are less loyal and may switch due to bad service, better deals, or boredom. Restaurants face this challenge; many people enjoy variety, while others return to places where they are treated well and find convenience.

Think of a lawyer's client. The lawyer cares for the client's specific needs, has their best interests at heart, and the relationship is based on trust and competence. The strategy of preeminence involves caring about clients to stay ahead of their issues, making the relationship enjoyable. It doesn’t have to be expensive but should feel personal. Premium brands and luxury items often follow this vision. You don’t need to know everyone deeply, but knowing their name and contact information for marketing communications and making them feel cared for is essential. CRM software helps collect this information, including payment history, product purchases, and marketing program data. There are various types of CRM software, depending on the vendor's focus.

A customer relationship is more transactional. You know them as a group rather than individuals. The relationship is about understanding them better to market to them, not to develop a one-on-one relationship. Think of Coca-Cola drinkers; they have a relationship with the brand, but the brand knows them as a group, reflected in their commercials and product marketing. CRM software also helps here, providing analytics to understand sales by dimensions like geography, product type, payment type, and acquisition channel.

Companies focusing on customers often scale more easily than those with clients. Understanding buyer demographics can be replicated in other regions, allowing horizontal growth. This kind of growth is often the lowest hanging fruit for many organizations, depending on the business model and ease of capturing new customer bases. Exceptions include franchises with heavy local regulations and individual services requiring physical presence.
