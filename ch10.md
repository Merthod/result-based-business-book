# 10. On Brands

What comes first, a product or a brand?

The answer may vary depending on who you ask. To me, most of the time the value proposition comes first, then the product, and finally the brand.

However, I follow common sense based on the situation at hand, so these guidelines are not set in stone. A value proposition is basically the promise your product fulfills. You need to know it first so you can develop a marketable product and then stamp it with your brand to make it recognizable.

However, marketing is behavior, and behavior doesn’t like absolutes. It does like “most-of-the-time-this-works” principles, though. If behavior liked absolutes, then good advertising would convert 100% of its intended audience, which almost never happens.

The interesting thing about behavior is that it can be influenced and designed. It’s like going to a fancy dinner; just the law of expectations will change how you behave at the table from what you usually do at home. A brand can also be set before the product to set the tone you want your audience to have. If the brand feels luxurious, for example, and its promise is fulfilled by a luxurious context (luxurious space, sophisticated-looking service personnel, attention to details such as the smell of the place or its expensive feel on booklets, furniture, etc.), then that will set its own law of expectations, which may vary depending on local culture, thus affecting behavior.

A brand needs enforcing too. Not everyone will get the subtle message and may behave differently, so the personnel may help set the tone respectfully.

There are exceptional situations that I more frequently find in social media where a content creator builds their following based on their content values, such as it being fun, controversial, complex but made accessible, educational, instructional, and so on. A lot of these creators have nothing to sell, so they promote other people’s products from time to time. Some have a strategic mindset, not selling anything on purpose until they get their branding right and find a product they’re comfortable promoting, whether it’s their own or not. Others even hack the branding process, leveraging our hardcoded behaviors to their advantage. For instance, a financial advisor on social media may always appear perfectly groomed and with their tie, some screens with graphics in a place with a nice view, so we may believe he’s a successful guy right from the get-go. Other financial advisors may go further into setting their environment as if it were a private conference filled with domain experts, using names that look official but aren’t, like “Senior Harvard Financial Association,” to make up a name that has nothing to do with the famous university but at first glance appears to.

People who make a brand first are usually more strategic, as they’re building the brand as they get to know their audience and what makes them tick.

If you’re observant, you may find that being brand-first would appeal to scammers. They are true teachers of the craft if one focuses on the efficacy of how they do it. According to some studies, the smarter the victim, the harder they fall for a scam. Be wary!

Sadly, many genuine organizations brand poorly, so they find tough luck reaping the benefits of a brand. Some don’t like to “put too many words in what they do” and prefer to show them. If you are one of them or know one of them who brands poorly, consider that if you don’t tell people you’re doing the right thing, people will go to whoever is doing the brand right, even if the value proposition is broken. This is a sad truth that ironically happens in the marketing and investing space. Too many marketers and “investors” promise quick-rich schemes and silver bullets, in a way that goes from generation to generation.

## The Worst and Best Types of Brands

The most popular branding strategy that’s pushed online is likely the “personal brand.”

It is okay if you really are a one-person show like a TV personality, or have a talent, are an employee, or are a professional in your field, but consider that if you tie your brand to yourself, then it will be hard or even impossible to separate you from it later on. In this case, the moment you stop working, the brand loses all of its value and thus, the business will lose much of its appeal.

If you intend to create a long-lasting business but you’re the main actor in it or want to be, create a name of its own and become its spokesperson or leader. If you are too visible within the brand, you’ll also tie yourself up to it, but it’s also easier to gradually dilute this perception as you introduce other faces and/or introduce your own processes handled by your team.

Many marketing experts like to promote creating a personal brand because being a recognized authority or famous is one of the common dreams people have.

It’s easy to read a few articles and books and claim your expertise in a topic. Or even be cheeky and learn through some YouTube channel. Many “crypto experts” are just like that. They read the news and learn a few investing methods and the buzzwords from the papers, so they start jargonizing their analysis to sound smart, and then promote their ploys in the hopes they work. It’s 50/50 for them, and if they fail, they’ll just blame whatever and go on with the next “silver bullet” investment strategy. Some productivity gurus claim that while you need to spend ten thousand hours to be a master in a domain, you only need a few days to be “good enough” at it, and that seems appealing to many. Especially those you may see these people who jump into one field to another: today they’re a marketing guru, tomorrow an investment expert that learned untold secrets, then a crypto bro who is sure that the scheme has a big future and will change world economies, then claim they can revolutionize a whole industry with AI, and then become an early “expert” in whatever large trend comes up next.

A good type of brand makes people identify your business with the value proposition. It’s like a bookmark for the mind. The mind sees, listens, or even feels an environment, and somehow the name comes up and what it is about.

It is good practice for you to define a brand before others define it for you (they probably won’t do it too kindly). You want to control your image and discourse about your business and yourself. When thinking of brands, think of your business or yourself on a stage in a spotlight, with some public that may or may not be interested in the play. They’ll quickly judge if the play is good or not based on your looks, how you talk, how you present, its values, the environment, and the context of the brand. Context meaning secondary elements that give more significance to your brand. It’s saying “Belgian chocolate.” The origin adds to the meaning of the value proposition in this case. And sometimes, brands also fake context, such as Häagen-Dazs ice cream; it sounds premium because it is a name that resembles premium European ice cream, but it wouldn’t have the same punch if they said “Premium ice cream from The Bronx.”

Astute businesses also create a brand persona to control communications. They talk to this persona, based on humanizing the brand as if it were one more of their target market. This is often faked, though. Such as giving a beloved auntie name and image to a hot cakes brand. Some marketers will die on the hill of creating and talking to the brand persona. A somewhat idealized person, but also realistic, of who the buyer is. Think of many premium and luxury models. They are just too beautiful for us to relate to them; also, they reflect an idealized lifestyle, but the product they are promoting is within our reach. A brand persona is a behavioral magnet for us to want to be like that. It is setting a standard and letting us reach it somehow. The principle is very simple, really. Just create an attractive, realistic person that is easy to relate to, even if you put them in a world of fantasy. A brand persona has the adventures, knowledge, and access to whatever the target market would also like.

More standard marketers create a product persona, which is a hypothetical person that is the average of the qualities, attributes, and lifestyle their target customer has. It doesn’t have anything aspirational in itself and it’s not intended to be a leader or a bellwether like the brand persona. Based on this profile, marketers create their messaging that can be aspirational.

To better distinguish both views, a brand persona is based on a brand, and a brand is a consistent set of elements consumed by our senses. All branded products should align with this vision. If there is more than one buyer profile, it helps for ads targeting and niche customization, but the main brand principles persist.

A product persona is a profile targeted for a specific product or service. Different products and services within the same house can target vastly different buyer profiles. So here we care more about the general demography and psychography within a geographical area, being it local, regional, national, or international. For instance, Walmart cares about the income levels of all of their segments and creates competitive advantages for themselves so they get better wholesale pricing that lets them attract as many of these niches as possible. They can serve a basket of basics (basic products that nearly all households buy) with varying levels of affordability. Or take Microsoft, whose products are sold to a vast array of consumer profiles, from the most basic computers to the most high-end machines. And yes, you can create several product personas per product so you create tailored messaging and advertising.

A new business might start with either type of persona, but more commonly it starts with a product persona. The idea is simple: first find a hungry audience, and then offer some good food.

I subscribe to the “brand response” philosophy with my marketing processes, where a brand is the result of good salesmanship and storytelling that uses an emotional closing technique and resolution so it gets more emotional responses. When the cards are played well, growth can be like a tsunami thanks to social media virality. For me, this is the best kind of branding, the one you can build as you directly sell. One iconic example is the Dollar Shave Club original ad you can find on YouTube. It has everything: the spokesman, a direct response ad, and brand building right there.

## The Superpowers of a Brand

A good brand does much more than serve as a bookmark for the mind.

It can help ease up the selling process right up to the level of the “Shut Up and Take My Money!” meme.

It can help the selling process in five key ways:

- Pre-qualify.
- Pre-motivate.
- Pre-dispose.
- Pre-interest.
- Pre-close.

Naturally, we are focusing on the people who already know the brand. Generally speaking, the more you expose your brand, the more potential buyers it can attract with less effort compared to other types of selling.

A well-designed brand helps pre-qualify potential buyers based on its value proposition. Some brands are meant for fun for the family, others for dependability when constructing other products, and so on. A clear value proposition immediately qualifies a potential buyer, and the brand can use that. That’s why having a descriptive name can help here. The previously mentioned example, Dollar Shave Club, is a great example of this. The name itself conveys a value proposition: affordable shaving blades.

If you choose a non-descriptive name, you should add a tagline or mantra that helps convey its value proposition, or showcase the product with its own value proposition. It’s critical to state the importance of clarity. The audience in the wild is easily confused by mixed messages and quick to swipe away.

To enhance the effectiveness of your messages, your brand persona or product persona must acknowledge motivated people. That means people who are already doing something towards a desired result relevant to your product and business. Pre-motivated people are already researching, buying information through books, magazines, and are already trying to fix their problems, probably badly or worse than you can do it for them.

This goes hand-in-hand with pre-disposition. If you show that both you and them have similar goals and values, there will be a pre-disposition to go with you. Other strong pre-disposition hooks are tying your vision and values to theirs. For example, people in the city may be stressed out by their overall responsibilities, so you can find what routine activities are a nuisance for them, such as grocery shopping, and then offer a solution where you help them buy the best healthy products for every day. This means buying the cheapest genuine cheese or the best health-rated diapers. This research may be annoying for many to do, and a grocery shopping service that is already an expert on that can make life much easier for them, probably even buying from cheaper sources other than their local stores so they can save a few bucks while also saving time not personally doing that. If you show we have similar values and the solution joins our goals, then it’s easy to relate and resonate with the brand promise (the value proposition).

Good brands don’t always talk about the product but talk a lot about the buyer and their problems and threats (everything else problematic that isn’t seen like a solvable problem but can be, like an assumed pain, assumed mediocrity, or not realizing one’s full potential), not as a buyer, but as a person. A good pitch makes some rhetorical questions or implications that make the buyer say in their mind “yes, yes, yes!” one time after another. Your customers have a story, values, struggles, aspirations, and interests. Great brands reflect all of this through storytelling (also visual storytelling). You might watch a movie and find some branded cookies being shown in the kitchen or some nice car being showcased in a car pursuit. This is pre-interest; it is hooking your brand into whatever the audience cares about. They like action-packed movies with car chases; people will then associate the car with a fun car to drive fast. Pre-interest is taking whatever interests your audience and being there. From sponsorships to you organizing events themselves, to simple storytelling in your advertisements, to where the product is stocked or bought. Like some people like to buy products from Amazon to get cheaper shipping with the bundle of other products they’re buying. This means they have an interest in saving money.

Many companies use their brand sales playbook or guidelines actively to pre-close a sale. Like Ferrari, which requires purchasing some base models to access its more exclusive models. Pre-close is also building on their motivations, their personal issues regarding their own goals to close the sale. They may want new windows because the draft and cold season is coming. Some products are just like that; they are bought because of a strong motivation. Acknowledging it can be pre-closing because it not only qualifies but speaks directly to their desires.

Another example of pre-close is using valuable intellectual property to make another offering much more appealing, like the Disneyland Park, which is based on characters from all of its famous movies. Without that, it would probably feel like a generic amusement park. A brand helps set many expectations you hardly get anywhere else. Many companies actively look for licensing deals because that branded intellectual property can make a boring product much more appealing. For a kid, it’s not the same having a generic towel than a Disney’s Cars themed one (or the trending character). They need a towel anyway, but the branding seals the deal. When a brand is a leader in its field for some important reason, it creates preeminence, meaning it is the go-to authority in their niche or market. This is the most trusted, respected, prestigious, and sought-after company for whatever proposition it has. If you can demonstrate leadership through content, reviews, and a detail-oriented multichannel marketing process, your brand will help you smash success. The Ritz-Carlton famously made the base of luxurious service in the service business through their Gold Standard. Other brands created products so good that their name became the namesake for that activity. To achieve this level of consistent success with a brand, you need top-quality principles within your organization’s culture, and we’ll see more about that later.

In brand-response type of advertising, the logo comes last, not first. Think of a letter when the logo accompanies the signature at the foot of the letter. This is an important annotation so you make the offer the king of your promotional content and not an empty brand that has little significance when it’s unknown. Don’t fall in love with logos; fall in love with great offers. The reputation will follow.

A brand overall creates a lot of value for an organization and leads to ease the process of selling, improving loyalty, and helps structure the company culture. The brand reflects guiding values, a vision, and goodwill that also helps create value for the whole company.

It is recommended that you develop a brand, define an aspirational brand persona (or solution-based product persona), and create your brand guidelines so it is consistent through all mediums, communications, personnel service traits, and the company culture reflecting expectations and responsibilities, similar to a religion.
