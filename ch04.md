# 4. The need for marketing

You have limited time available throughout the day.

Say you’re a world-class magician. The field is competitive as more magicians pop up on social media and others debunk tricks, making them less impressive. You need to stay on the edge of your craft.

To be on the edge of your craft, you need to focus on your skills and tricks. Believe it or not, you need to study a lot.

Imagine that you’re a solopreneur in this scenario and you have quite the lifestyle. You have a mansion, nice cars, travel a lot, even yachting. You share this lifestyle on social media. But when the camera is off, you’re studying and traveling to learn tricks and find tutors.

Imagine being so busy, having great expenses, and to top it off, you need to get gigs. Not just any gigs, you need well-paid gigs. If you get known for landing poorly paid gigs, you devalue yourself and won’t be able to continue affording your lifestyle. You need this lifestyle in order to travel and learn from the best and foremost around the world. The moment you go stagnant, other magicians will surpass you.

So not only do you need to land gigs, but you need to have all this “machinery” going to keep the act truly magical.

There are a bunch of words, some buzzwords, thrown around marketing.

Some of my favorites are:

- Marketing is psychology.
- Marketing is a buzzword for selling.
- Marketing is trickery.
- Marketing is cheating the customer into thinking something you or your product is not.
- Marketing is positioning.
- Marketing is manipulation.
- Marketing is advertising.

These, and many more words, are often thrown around to explain what marketing is.

Marketing is a process, really.

Similar to accounting, which is a process that takes all expenses and income in order to get a profit and pay taxes accordingly through a tax plan, marketing is a process that can be slightly “magical.”

Bear with me for a moment. A business basically takes some raw materials, some skills, and some ideas to not only make a final consumable product but to put this product in the hands of its user. And not only that, somehow businesses make users want this product so they look for it.

Marketing highlights the humanity of productivity and comfort.

Not only do marketers digest complex business processes into simple processes users go through to get the products, but they also make it as profitable as possible.

Yes, marketing is a process. A big process.

In this sense, we can say that the big process is like a Matryoshka doll, or Russian nested dolls. You’ve seen those, it’s a smaller doll inside a bigger doll, inside another doll, and so on.

The marketing process hides smaller processes within it.

If we take an eagle’s view of the marketing process, we can see three basic elements that make it: a business producing some product, a market that demands such a product, and an offer that enables the market to buy from the business.

If we start zooming in on each element, we find smaller processes.

So, we zoom in on the business itself. We see the business integrating its knowledge in order to make a product or service, package it, and deliver it to stores closer to the buyers.

If we zoom in on the market, we see people, somehow labeled either by their own interests, like “head of a family,” going to the market, buying products, using them, and disposing of them. Sometimes the process is quite complex, and we see buyers not returning to buy more, but to find similar or replacement products in other markets. For instance, a user may not return to the market of new cars and instead go to the market of used cars or be chauffeured (ubered).

If we zoom in into the offer, we also find a process. We see that a product probably isn’t priced the same in different places. Some online stores have it cheaper than others, and we may see that some physical stores have unique bundle offerings trying to compete with the online offerings. We see different ways the offer gets communicated by some influencer or served through an ad, getting people to go somewhere and get the offer. The offer makes whatever is necessary to move the product to the hands of the buyer in the most lucrative way.

Processes may vary a lot between businesses, but they are always there.

Marketing is a special beast compared to other common business processes, like management, production, accounting, and supply chain. While that bunch may be very similar from one business to another, marketing is unique to some extent. Hardly any business can get rich simply by copying what other businesses do. But you can copy the efficiency and productivity other businesses have in their other processes. For instance, Toyota famously packaged the Six Sigma quality philosophy into a product that other businesses can adopt to improve their own quality within
