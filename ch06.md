# 6. Why Grow a Business?

Businesses have evolved over centuries.

There are records of businesses started more than a thousand years and they’re probably still running today. Not in the exact same way, though. Kongō Gumi Co., Ltd., a Japanese construction business opened in 578, has more than 1,400 years old and still runs, although it was acquired. Its main activity is the construction and maintenance of Buddhist temples.
Bars, breweries, candy manufacturers, restaurants, mills, coin minting, and many more companies that have well over a century running, can easily be imagined to continue functioning in the foreseeable future.

These are businesses that have survived economic, political, societal, legal, war, invasion, famine, technological shakedowns, and whatnot and have successfully adapted these changes.

What these old businesses can teach us better than anyone else is the changing nature of their environment over time. Demand changes. I don’t suspect that there are as many Buddhist temples being built today as before. Yet, this business has survived well.

Modern times are led by capitalism. Capitalism is known of being violent, as its flagship promoter, the U.S.A., is the country with the most wars fought. Capitalism is best for the people who are in a developed country, typically located in the Northern hemisphere, rather than in one that had the less fortune of getting the short stick and is a country sunk in debt, poverty and little to none economic development.

Capitalism has many elements that are more or less relevant today, and will continue to change over time.

For starters, there is competition. The competition among businesses that want more market share, better access to limited resources and more customers. Competition leads to many strategies, tactics and stratagems to get an upper hand. The latter being the lesser ethical. The best strategies for being competitive include having a superior product, effective customer service and an efficient supply chain. Underhanded practices include aggressive marketing tactics, intellectual property disputes and sometimes even boycott. Historically, John D. Rockefeller was infamous of boycotting his rivals, even internationally.

Capitalism also justifies economic inequality. You have rich and poor countries that interact within the system, and inside each country, you also have significant disparities of the richer and poorer social groups. This inequality sparks criminality, corruption, social unrest and even political instability.

Capitalism likes expansion and with expansion comes colonialism and imperialism. This way, the stronger countries force their economic system on colonized territories through force, exploitation and subjugation. Today we don’t see many wars in the style of the old-time invasions, but we see a lot of commercial and monetary warfare. Countries choking or outright blocking commerce with other countries and using its influence to force other countries also limit their interactions with the subjugated country. The U.S.A. has famously done this with Cuba, Venezuela and China. The European Union has done it with Russia. These initiatives have led to alternative economic synergies, such as the BRICS (an economic alliance between Brazil, Russia, Indonesia, China and South Africa), that enable these countries to continue growing and developing elsewhere despite tensions.

Globalization has also played a role. Expansion in capitalism goes well beyond borders. Multinational corporations and international trade agreements may exacerbate existing power imbalances between countries that have sometimes resulted in wars. A famed Mexican political cartoonist and educator, Rius, once said, “the United States doesn’t have friends, they have interests.” The powerful governments have usually helped their strongest corporations be active in subdued territories with unfair benefits, like less taxation and more leeway in exploitative practices, such as lower pollution controls and easy access to strategic national resources like minerals or fresh water. Central banking experts around the world have also explained that institutions like the International Monetary Fund invest in countries through the invading corporations accompanied with privatization deals that guarantee good business for them. Hardly any of these investments reach the people in need other than some jobs created, which is what a mediocre government that accepts such deals is happy with for the headlines.

The Rothschilds, were all out against slavery back in the 19th century. A famous banking family that quickly invaded Europe with their banks and observed that “give me control of the economy of a nation and I care little of who makes her laws.” The thing is, albeit slavery is bad, it also forced the owner to care for their slave to their death. That meant less profits. With slavery abolished, now they could get rid of workers when they didn’t need them anymore. Given how violent the industrial revolution was through its own environments: hot and unventilated factories, little to none sanitary policies, extremely long work hours, and virtually no rights for the worker, you could even see a worker as little as four years old without a hand because of a cotton mill accident in New England and here you could start seeing new wave of street beggars of accidented workers out of a job.

Influential capitalist families like the Rothschilds, and some others, agitated economies through levering the value of ever-inflating currency and the inducive power it has to make people do activities they normally wouldn’t do, such as getting into a large debt, to simply afford their everyday lives. This is no small thing, since banking families finance wars, coup d’etats and revolutions to protect and expand their influence and interests while keeping you legally tied to your own national currency since banks don’t offer multicurrency accounts unless you’re very rich. They also push hard a lot of propaganda that shape the way of life, using their influence and interests, to control discourse, align social values and progressively censor whatever doesn’t align to their views or prefer not to be discussed too much about how this system is at its best. You can find this propaganda in all areas, from academics to the mafia-like TV series. Their monetary systems create an ever-balancing economy prone to crashes, increased use of credit and less durable wealth for the mass though less ownership of hard assets.

We all play inside these systems with their rules, and the promise of getting wealthy makes us conform with the system as is, even if it’s constantly deteriorating. The entrepreneurial dream. The assumption that anyone could be the next Steve Jobs, one of the very few super successful entrepreneurs that didn’t come from old money. It’s like playing lottery not by buying tickets, but by taking risks within the system, and hopefully hit the jackpot through a machine we call a company. Some of us will not get a top 10 global company, but fortunately there are varying levels of success that will appease our ambitions. Capitalism engages into military, commercial and propagandistic warfare to establish and protect itself, and naturally, we play along by engaging competition and by applying Darwinian principles to the market: the survival of the fittest. It’s about playing the game, not only making a good product and servicing the people. You could know much more about creating a hamburger than McDonalds, but they play the money game better than most of us.

The ever-deteriorating part of the monetary system is key here. Money slowly loses its purchase power due to inflation, so saving money isn’t smart long-term. Products and services become ever so slightly more expensive over time as the currency used to buy them deteriorates. That’s why you see ads from 10 to 50 years ago listing houses, cars and everything much cheaper than it is today. This is not obvious short-term, but pretty apparent long-term. Sadly, wages aren’t growing on par with inflation in most countries, so the long-term divergence between price increases and wage increases. Bankers fix this by creating an opportunity for themselves: easier access to credit. Failure to pay the full debt gives them customers for life!

This is survival of the fittest. As a business owner, you need to know how to use money, how to invest money, how to spend money, how to plan for taxes, and overall, how to organize your money so you live free. This knowledge doesn’t come on its own and is depends on where and how you operate legally. Freedom of debt is what modern-day freedom is all about. However, as a business owner, growth usually comes much faster with debt, and this induces oneself to consider it. Be careful with adding debt to your business though. One kind of debt requires you to concede some equity, meaning you risk your business going bankrupt if you fail to pay the debt as negotiated. The second is financing, in which you put some collaterals, hopefully purchase orders and producing assets, to finance your ongoing operations.

Also, as a business owner you need to make your business work effectively given its circumstances. Say employee requirements (such as training, competitive pay, availability and rotation), competitive environment, business model scalability (is it difficult or expensive to double its current size?), leadership, market circumstances (growing?) and noise (difficulty to reach effectively your best buyers), barriers of entry, switching costs, and many other defense mechanisms existing businesses usually implement to protect their business, such as branding, patents and market preeminence.

So, in one hand you have the shrinking monetary value through inflation given that you must charge in the relevant national currency. And this is true for all national currencies (and they wonder why Bitcoin is widely accepted by the masses as a secondary store of value?) including the financing or debt requirements for your business to operate. And in the other hand, you have the complex dynamics of the markets and their players, each competing in whatever way conceivable, ethical or not, to not to lose against other businesses.

In other words, since money loses value, take 3% interest annually, $1,030,000 of year 1 money would purchase exactly the same as $1 million at year 0. And it only gets worse at times goes on. By year 2, it takes $1,060,900 to buy exactly the same as $1 million at year 0. As you can see, it’s not linear, it compounds by taking into consideration each year’s devaluation.

Also, nothing guarantees that at year 1 you sell at least the exact same $1 million of year 0. If other business people acknowledge how profitable your market is, they might enter it and they might be better at marketing than you, including having a better product, with better distribution, price, and everything else we saw in the previous chapter, The Marketing Process.

Growth doesn’t equal scale. This means that your corner shop doesn’t need to eventually try to be Walmart, or that your Shopify store needs to eventually get on par with Amazon.
Grow can simply mean getting a few more customers and sales by each accounting period to effectively defend against inflation and the many risks surrounding your business. But hopefully it means more than that, so that what growth attracts, stays.

Understand that in any case, growth needs to exist. Success gives much better problems than failure. Even growing too fast gives better problems than not growing at all. Tesla has famously had this problem and implemented a backorder system.
Growth is a systemic and capitalist need. It helps if you create a mindset towards growth practices, market evolution and expansive thinking, even if you don’t want to be like Steve Jobs. It helps more becoming overqualified than underqualified to run the business. And that’s why I suggest to read this entire book and digest the core lessons into your thinking and practices.
