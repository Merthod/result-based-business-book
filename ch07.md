# 7. Can all business grow equally?

In short, no.

To better understand why not, we first have to understand what scale is.

Scaling is the measure of how much demand a business can serve, and includes how flexible the business is to expand its internal operations such as customer acquisition and external operations such as acquiring other businesses.

As previously mentioned, growth doesn’t equal scale. If you sell fish and see that the whole nation eats fish, you don’t need to measure growth relative to how much of the national market you serve, which is probably much less than 1%.

First, growth limits depend on the business model and its leadership.

The more similar the business model is to rivals, the less potential for growth it has. A corner shop that looks pretty much the same as the next corner shop will hardly dominate.

On the other hand, if the business is effectively differentiated, it may have potential for growth and even domination. Walmart is effectively differentiated, and that’s why when a new store opens, similar stores of all sizes surrounding the area worry.

Now, it’s likely that you might think that branding has much to do with this, and it does, but as we have already learned, marketing is much more than promotion, where branding is just one (big) element. Walmart leverages its marketing mix to the fullest, having strong supply chains, including advantageous relationships with suppliers, sensible pricing that adds to the advantage, and a wide variety of products, which adds to their efficiency of managing inventory. They take their advantages further by using information technology, which processes tons of transactional data to generate irresistible offerings all the time. Their operation methods are so sophisticated that they effectively made their business a machine we all simply know as Walmart.

You don’t need to be a corporation to do the same principal marketing activities. You do need to embrace marketing as a whole to realize all the potential it has to offer. Many businesses limit their marketing understanding to branding and advertising, and then spend little on that. Many businesses disconnect marketing from operations and service. Many businesses don’t even understand their buyers, and so they always worry about selling tomorrow. Even worse, many solopreneurs focus on building a “personal brand” which hinders growth as they become the center of the business model, so their personal outputs become the outputs of the business.

But the worst part is having a commodity product and a commodity business model. That’s total undifferentiation that does nothing to help buyers see the value, uniqueness, and magnetism of your offerings. In some cases, it may even work against your business, as people mentally tag your business negatively automatically. If it’s dirty, ugly, looks unattended, looks like a mess, negative attributes will be associated with your business. If you communicate bluntly, don’t communicate updates, don’t show interest in listening, don’t make eye contact, use closed body gestures such as arms crossed, a frown, or slouching, or have zero empathy, people will probably think twice before going back. If it doesn’t look chic, taste chic, and feel chic, it isn’t chic.

Businesses grow on a variety of factors, but the most basic one is effective marketing.
A good differentiated product presented at the right time to the right audience is the key to mass sales. Timing makes closing sales easier, and the way to effectively close without you being there is through persuasive copy (shown as text, video, or whatever media) that leverages all the information you typically use to target an ad: an audience demographic (who), the problem/solution or burning psychological desire/opportunity and proof (what), the result (why), the transformation (how), and a compelling reason to buy now (when).

Every business has the potential to go beyond their current business plan constraints. For instance, a corner shop or a coffee shop may have a constrained business plan. McDonald's franchise owners originally wanted to sell rotisserie chicken just to sell more, and there was once even an official pizza offering in the 80s. However, when we look at such businesses that managed to grow, we see much more than a product; we see a sustained business strategy that helps them differentiate, called “competitive advantage”. McDonald's found big success when it included trademarked toys from current children’s movies. Then there were their unique ice creams. Then it found success with their breakfast menus and with that, coffee sales. Many small McDonald's spots focus on selling coffee today, competing with Starbucks.

Other businesses sell other people’s products, meaning they can’t differentiate those products, but they do differentiate the offerings. For instance, in the Internet Marketing category, there is marketer A who is sharing a method on Facebook Ads that has let them scale campaigns while reducing cost per conversion, a really nice training. Marketers B and C, which operate in a similar space within the Internet Marketing category, promote this course to their own audiences for a commission, making a commission per sale. Neither of them, B and C, created the product, so they can’t change anything to differentiate it. Say you’re on both email lists B and C, you like them both similarly, so there’s no preference bias. They both promote the course to you and you want it. Who do you buy it from? Hold your thought a moment before answering. Now consider that marketer C added a bonus of their own. They shared their own tool letting you automatically reply to ads comments to further interest into a conversion and add email sequences to your own pipeline for very cheap compared to doing this separately for 3 full months, thus potentially pushing your conversion profits further. Would that bias your decision to buy from marketer C? You might think, depends on the price. Now consider the bonus, as the name implies, comes for free along with the main offer. Both offers cost exactly the same. Ah, I almost forgot. There’s a clock ticking, you have to decide soon or both offers disappear. What will it be?

Businesses that suffer from commoditization need to develop differentiating value elsewhere. All supermarkets sell produce, a commodity. Yet, they surround it with branded products that add to the visit to fill the shopping cart. The walls that surround the market make it convenient to just buy here. It’s a similar logic to the bonus, albeit not included for the price. Anyway, it’s easier said than done. If you’re in a produce market then the context, the environment, won’t help much. There are no such walls like in the supermarket. Competitors are probably at the very next booths. You might still create some value by having the better produce selection, better prices for volume buyers, and good service. There’s an iconic case called FISH! that differentiated through awesome service that even became some sort of entertainment show. Throwing fish from side to side from the booth, their playful environment filled with enthusiasm and positive energy, making the customers’ day by finding ways to surprise and delight, and finally, the core of their philosophy, choosing your attitude. Make a good day be a decision, and let all the following events light up with that. Keeping the positive attitude will help plow through the bad smell, the not-so-great job itself, and the long hours that come with attending such a business. Even if the day sucks and you are frustrated, any top salesman would recommend keeping those bad emotions to yourself. No buyer needs the bad vibe, especially when looking for sales.

Even with that outstanding culture, that fish market won’t likely be on par with Microsoft, but it has reached its potential as a single booth business and it certainly has grown beyond what an average fish booth usually sells. Theirs even became a tourist attraction!

Other businesses, like a corner shop, may find unique products to differentiate, style the shop somehow, or the owner might be even more resourceful and create growth elsewhere, like in a second business that uses the shop as a hook, such as dry cleaners. Giving people the chance to do more in the trip seems convenient for them. It’s similar to what a big mall does: the movie theater is the hook and many other businesses benefit from the walking traffic nearby.
You can see it now. Growth can happen in a variety of ways.

Many business owners have a tunnel vision in which they can only make money with their products or services on hand, never allowing themselves to be creative, as a business maker, to build upon their audiences and their needs. Tunnel vision feels comfortable when everything runs smoothly. You have a recurrent big buyer, sales are coming because your amazing location doesn't require trying too hard on the marketing stuff, or demand is so great that you even sell while being a jerk, such as many landlords of prime commercial or living real estate in big cities usually are.

Then there are personal services businesses, either professional or blue-collar. Growth here depends much on how you organize your work. For instance, architects may work independently or create a studio where they employ other architects. Web designers may also work alone or bundle their product with that of data analysts and a marketer to create enhanced websites for commerce. Bundling like this affects the type of project they work on. As an independent web designer, the freelancer may earn an amount similar to a well-paid job, but as a bundle, they may handle million-dollar projects. Similarly for architects, medical doctors, handymen, and even academics. An academic alone may be like a personal tutor, but as a group, they may start a university.

Freelancers too can create marketing machines that maximize their service pipeline flow, both improving profits and keeping a healthy, constant busy time. They too can create secondary products, like digital resources, to supplement their business and join efforts with other freelancers. It’s not uncommon for a real-estate agent to get a commission when recommending an interior designer.

Again, not all businesses can grow equally. But they can grow somehow. The key is being creative with their business model, finding some source of sustained differentiation, joining efforts, and running away from commoditization. There is a lot more to say regarding this, like going deeper into what “being creative with their business model” can mean, so continue reading.
