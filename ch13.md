# 13. The Power of Words

Gary Halbert, a legend in copywriting from the late 20th century, illustrated the power of words very clearly. He was a powerhouse copywriter specializing in writing direct mail—the old mail letters that required postage.

He said, and I’m paraphrasing, imagine you have two sheets of paper, your pen, and two envelopes. Exactly the same variable costs. You write two letters to your mother.

First, you write about how lucky you feel to have her in your corner. You’re grateful for all the time and love she invested in you. You recognize you’re not always the best daughter or son you could be, but you see her effort in always being available when you need her. You commend the effort she put into raising you. You end your letter with “I love you, Mom.” Sign it, put it in the envelope, seal it, and post it.

In the second letter, you write about how miserable you are because of your mother. You despise how she didn’t always support you in your crazy ideas and blame her for being insecure. There aren’t enough words to describe how much you despise her and wish you hadn’t even met her. Her motherly efforts were pathetic. Her support worthless. You end your letter with, “I hope we won’t need to speak to each other again.” Sign it, put it in the envelope, seal it, and post it.

In terms of costs, both letters cost exactly the same, but the responses will be as different as day is from night. Words can be used to solve all the problems of the world or be weapons to cripple it. Imagine a person somehow reading every day, “You’re not enough.” This phrase will drill into their mind and damage it, probably to an irreparable level.

Untreated psychological problems can become physical illnesses, and most of these problems start by welcoming ill words into our psyche. When writing and structuring presentations, your words will matter. Words are more than mere tools for communicating ideas. They’re used to describe literally everything and anything, from health to mindless enjoyment.

In selling, use your words to empower the buyer by letting them choose the better path. Make it obvious in your presentation what that path is, but let them make the choice and then close hard. If they are indecisive, then soft close them by guiding them to the best understanding of the deal and its value. “If I added X guarantee, would that be enough for you to buy now?” is an example of a soft-closing question, looking for what the gap is to close the deal.

In marketing, content should soft sell your offerings in passing while describing the issues the potential buyers are facing. This can be done with testimonials, examples, mentions, images, stories, and more. Soft selling means plugging a link where relevant, without turning content into a hard-sell pitch and making the reader feel annoyed by falling for such a cheap trick. Hard-sell pitches should be asked for. If people click the soft-selling link, they’re asking for more information about the offering, so hard sell it now.

### How to Ask for the Hard-Sell in Print or Digital Media?

In most cases, the headline does the trick. A great headline essentially makes a useful promise based on the Unique Selling Proposition and then adds urgency and curiosity to make the reader look for more. Some advertising agencies have reported that a great headline is about 80% of the sale, so that’s how important it is. Two identical sales pages, text or video, that differ only in the headline may perform significantly differently. One may be a loser, and the other a homerun, just because of the headline.

### How to Ask for the Hard-Sell in Other Types of Media?

In other non-print media, such as phone selling or face-to-face, asking great questions does the trick. Understanding the other party and identifying a SWOT in the potential buyers’ dialogue will open the door to plug your pitch correctly.

SWOT is an acronym for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Say you’re selling ERP software, which helps manage a company, from manufacturing, people, and sales inventory to its financial performance. Asking questions to the buyers, such as “What are you using currently?” and “Why did you choose it?” will help you understand the company’s position towards their current software. Selling ERP software is particularly hard because it’s expensive, often requires training, and to customize it you usually need certified professionals who know some programming language to create custom reports. So, there’s usually little incentive to change the current solution.

But as they say, everything is possible. Sometimes the current solution was pushed by an important client that uses the same software. Sometimes it’s chosen semi-randomly by being approached by another salesperson who plugged a hole (they didn’t have anything but Excel, and it was chaos).

Asking questions will help identify what strengths their current solution has, starting with the fact that they already invested in it. Then, identify weaknesses. Maybe it doesn’t have enough flexibility to customize or display in different kinds of media, it’s expensive to customize, it’s ugly, it’s slow, it’s too expensive to maintain, or has an annoying learning curve. It’s not about asking “magic” sales questions but asking to understand and learn about their business and context to better fit your pitch later.

If the salesperson can compound their current weaknesses (what’s not great about their offering) into opportunities without sacrificing the strengths (what they like about the current solutions or an enhancement of them), then they can create opportunities. But without a good enough offer, the sale probably won’t close, so there are the threats. Threats are whatever limitations, misunderstandings, unappealing features, weak offerings (like minimal guarantees or too many price tiers), sacrifices (exchanging tit for tat), or bad sales service (like poor follow-up) that can jeopardize the sale.

Selling is all about learning about this SWOT that exists in the potential buyer’s perception and reality and hooking your solution to that, creating a lot of perceived value. Selling isn’t about formulas as much as it is about understanding the other party’s perceptions and reality, especially for complex sales cycles, and balancing the SWOT in your favor to the point of being irresistible.

### Be Careful

One of my favorite quotes from the movie _Margin Call_ is these two words: “Be careful,” when a recently fired risk manager tells his number two upon giving him a flash drive while being escorted out of the building. It says a lot with very few words. It sets up the shit show that’s about to come. It creates a lot of curiosity and expectation about what privileged information on an assumed very large financial company is contained in that small drive.

Words can set up new fantasy worlds, they can create real division between people, they can tell moving stories, they do a lot for educating a person, they can create business from thin air, they can forge relationships, they can set up love, they can give hope to many people at once, and they can manipulate almost any emotion the speaker wants through storytelling.

Gary Halbert said that a sales letter could solve any problem. This is a truth that is understood when you find how much power you can have with them. Respect the words. Use them wisely. Be assertive, meaning say what’s best for the situation, not to hurt, gossip, or intimidate. When criticizing, consider the difference between criticizing a questionable action and not the whole person who did it. It’s not the same saying, “That statement is dumb” versus “You are dumb.”

Don’t get into personal problems because you aren’t careful about how you’re using those invisible weapons unassertively.

**Miguel Ruiz's Agreements**
Miguel Ruiz summarizes much of this in his four agreements book plus his fifth agreement book:

1. Be impeccable with your words.
   _Constantly optimize your wording to be more persuasive, simple and entertaining._
2. Don't take anything personally.
   _Focus on your audience, not you._
3. Don't make assumptions.
   _Verify your assumptions and don’t test heavily based on hunches or what you believe is “the way”. Remember, you sell because of your reasons, and buyers buy because of their reasons._
4. Always do your best.
   _In business it is important to push your boundaries by listening, thinking out of the box and have your word worth their promise weight in gold._
5. Be skeptical, but learn to listen.
   _Sometimes, the customer is right. Especially when they’re criticizing you, they want you to be better and telling how what you need to fix._
