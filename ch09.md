# Product development

A good product sits at the core of a strong business. Products can be tangible or intangible. Intangible products are sometimes called services, like a Tarot reading or a cellphone plan, but they can also be digital products like a streamed movie, a music file, and others. The key to a good business is finding or creating profitable products, ideally those that bring revenue in the long term.

Many businesses invest in research and development to ideate, prototype, and test new products. This includes the legalities necessary to launch properly, like filing for patents and complying with other regulations, especially for consumable products like food, beauty, and health. But it may also include trademarking the name and its iconography for any business.

Most small businesses depend on the research and development of products made by larger businesses. For instance, the car industry created the need for repairs and aftermarket upgrades. Not only that, but what about international commerce? Many small businesses import Chinese tech products at advantageous prices and sell them on their own platforms or third-party platforms, like eBay, Amazon, or MercadoLibre in Latin America. Some businesses invest seriously in these projects to the extent that they offer warranties for those imported products, developing strong commercial relationships with their distributors. A popular business model emerged around this concept, called drop-shipping, a great model to bootstrap a business where you buy directly from the manufacturer and then ship it directly to your buyer. You need to invest zero money to get started. But drop-shipping is hard to scale because you don’t control the logistics.

Big businesses don’t overlook these opportunities. Amazon sells their own line of products with some controversies (such as copying designs from others for their own Amazon Basics brand) and has a direct-from-China section featuring low-price products directly from China, with the trade-off of longer shipping times.

Competition is multidirectional now. You don’t only compete with the business across the street but also with larger businesses with specialized product lines—local, regional, or multinational—and sometimes questionable business practices, or even outright illegal ones, as happens in Mexico where Chinese suppliers openly sell products that lack local regulations while openly displacing local businesses.

Many people make the mistake of creating a product they think is great because they would use it themselves and extrapolate that into a market without any proper validation. They develop a product only to find it lacks market demand. I’ve seen developers building software products that solved their unique situation in their work environment, only to find little interest outside. In the software development industry, problems can be unique and unappealing to the niche because they depend on the tech stack one is using.

The best way to develop a product is similar to finding a good restaurant when you’re strolling in some unknown city. Find the one with a bunch of people eating there. Basing your product on social proof is a strong way to develop a product. Pre-launches are a good way to validate demand before the product even exists. It’s like having people waiting in line to get a promised yummy burger. Only that your yummy burger must be somehow interesting—different—from others to get that line growing.

It's okay to start a product based on a personal problem, but also see who else has this problem. This reminds me of one of the most killer advertising headlines ever created: "Who Else Wants a Successful Direct-Mail Package?" Yes, the example is old, but it is the lede of one of the greatest sales letters ever created, and the headline is used as a template today for many products in many industries:

- Who Else Wants An Executive-Level Promotion?
- Who Else Wants Whiter Teeth For A Radiant Smile?
- Who Else Wants An Effective Morning Routine To Start Their Day Right?
- Who Else Wants To Save Money On Groceries Every Week?
- Who Else Wants To Learn Guitar Without Spending Hours Practicing Each Day?
- Who Else Wants To Build Muscle And Burn Fat At Home?
- Who Else Wants To Master Public Speaking And Deliver Powerful Presentations?

And so on.

You can see how each and every one of these headlines attracts a whole niche. Also, you can see how the question doesn’t convey a closed yes/no but a self-qualifying answer. If you qualify for any of those questions, at least you’re curious to see what it is. If you qualify yourself thinking, “yes, I want it,” then you’re already on the tracks of probably buying the product. Some marketing agencies have found that the headline (or lede) can make up to 80% of a buying decision, so it wouldn’t be a good idea to only give it five minutes of thought. All of the greatest old-school copywriters I knew spent more time on the headline than on anything else when crafting their sales letter, and they did it last so they had the whole idea of the letter itself. Now with AI, it's so much easier to analyze and extract great ledes to test. We are living some amazing times!

In any case, I’m not suggesting dumping the work to the AI agent and calling it a day, but to use it to develop ideas so you can edit, rearrange, and test. Selling has a strong human element that machines might probably never be able to completely replicate. At least no one can say they don’t know where to start or are stuck getting some ideas flowing with these amazing tools at hand.

## Selling yourself the product idea

Years ago, I found out about the Amazon PR/FAQ memo, which I’ve been using since for myself and clients to help structure product ideas. What’s funny about this memo is that it resembles a letter, so you may even consider this memo an early first draft for one after you find a promising product.

Outlined in the book “Working Backwards” by Colin Bryar and Bill Carr, it starts with the customer and their needs, and then works backwards to an ideal product or service that delights them.

In the next paragraphs, I will outline the memo along with some copywriting secrets to make it as powerful as possible.

We start with:

**The Press Release**

It is an overview of the problem and its solution.

- Define a headline, a subtitle (second strongest headline), and the date.
- Intro paragraph.
- State the problem paragraph.
- State how the product solves the problem paragraph.
- A quote from a spokesperson from the company.
- How the product or service works?
- Customer quote.
- How to get started. A call to action.

Then we move on with:

**The Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

Consider questions from the buyers:

- About quality (durability, construction, future improvements, production-grade, and whatever applies).
- About price.
- About getting help regarding the usage or client-side assembly of the product, including maintenance.
- About who this product is for.
- About who this product is not for.
- About guarantees or “what if it’s not for me?”
- About who is behind the product.

**And the stakeholders**

- About profitability and the profitability of using distribution partners. Licensing might be relevant here, especially for an intangible product.
- About the market appeal or “what niche or 'hole' in the market does this product fill?”
- About costs and how can they be optimized in the future.
- About how easy it is to replicate for competitors and even a buyer exactly or near exactly (barriers of entry) in terms of skill, time, equipment, money. Like a lot of people can probably make a better burger than McDonalds, but they won’t do it in 5 minutes or less.
- About competitors.
- About the talent required, specialization, or sourcing.
- About the intellectual capital behind it, from brands to specialized processes to compliance with international, federal, state, industry, or any other relevant regulations.

Focus on the most key questions for your case, not all, since information is still limited and too many assumptions can derail your project.

Then, add any visuals, diagrams, or wireframes you have.

Finally, share the memo with team members, some of your target audience, and any trusted person who will listen. Observe how easily they grasp the idea and how enthusiastic they are about it, especially if they’re a potential buyer. If you can spark some sudden interest in discussing it more, then you might have a basis for a product and find yourself going to the next step, making a prototype.

## The Fateful MVP

The Minimal Viable Product is a methodology to develop new products based on obtaining the maximum validated learning about customers with the least effort. It is a testing methodology to validate assumptions about what customers want, need, or are willing to pay for, without investing significant resources (time, money, effort, and other capital) into building a fully-featured product upfront.

In practical terms, the MVP is very complicated. It can mean making a simple landing page to gauge demand, like in a pre-sale. Or it might be a functional product with key features. In any case, its purpose is to gather feedback so you invest wisely your resources.

My problem with the MVP is exactly that—it has some level of abstraction of what “minimal” means to you in your specific case. Creating a landing page to introduce the product pre-launch, and maybe even to collect some advancements, is hardly a “product” for me. If you find Kickstarter-type platforms familiar, considering your Kickstarter page part of the product itself is too weird for me. You’d need to ask me to be very liberal with our definition of what a product is.

To me, a product is whatever you can add a price sticker to. Creating a page to ask for money in advance is just that—a promise. The money paid has nothing to do with the landing page itself. For me, for the landing page to be seen as a product, I’d need to specifically sell the landing page itself.

And we haven’t even discussed the abstraction layers of what viable is, the V in MVP. If you are creating a reduced product for testing, where exactly is the line that separates viable from unviable, considering the also lax definition it has of what a product might be?

You may think, “well, it's the minimal product a person might pay for.” But sometimes the features you choose might seem arbitrary. Imagine that you’re developing the word processor akin to Microsoft Word; what would be the MVP for that? A white page that enables you to type some text? But what if I won’t pay for it if it can already edit such text, or to me, I want the processor to help me publish articles directly online? Both are valid features for a new product.

You need to minimize the arbitrary definitions that the generic MVP method introduces and create a Minimal Lovable Product, or a Minimal Enjoyable Product, or just a product.

For your initial iteration, it’s much better if you create a simple product in its own right. You could say it’s a testing product, but that wouldn’t change that it is a simple product. A simple product has its own features that make it complete by its definition. Say, “the Word Processor that lets you publish directly online.” Here we are promoting the exact features of our simple product. The product can evolve over time as you find more interest in it.

This is how many page builders for websites are built. They started with a simple promise: to help you design a website without needing to code. It had a lot of limitations on what you could do primarily with your mouse, but as they continued development, it became more complete and feature-packed so you could easily achieve a new promise: “develop any type of website without code.” Feedback did help, as people wanted reusable components they could use across many website projects, easily integrate third-party fonts, and then adapt sophisticated user interfaces to fine-grain most of the design without code.

It's not that MVP is wrong; the idea is great. The problem is how one interprets it, and this can be confusing. If I’m asking you about a Simple Value Proposition, just say what’s the main idea behind the product in a way that sounds compelling. In the 70s, Domino’s Pizza would have answered, “hot fresh pizza in less than 30 minutes or it’s free.” Its later sophistication was to elevate their business model into a franchise, so all could fulfill the same promise.

In any case, a simple product, or minimal if you may, should be a complete product in its own right. If it fails to fulfill its promise, nobody will love it, nobody will use it, and failure can be easily foreseeable. From the Simple Value Proposition, you should also be able to sell it on a landing page if you may, but we know that’s a promotional strategy and even a financing strategy, not a product.

## Hiring clients and proposition hypotheses

Until you find a value proposition that attracts business-building demand, at this stage, your propositions can be called hypotheses. You’re testing whether your assumptions of what the market wants actually generate enough demand.
You are free to create as many propositions as you want, but you should only test one per page or letter. When selling, clarity is part of the winning formula, so avoid confusing your audience by promising many things at once. Lead by one big promise, and like the sun and the planets, everything else is around that big promise. No stealing the spotlight.
After you see the big picture of who you are selling to and what you are selling, it is time to focus on your niche with a Napoleonic mindset: you want to dominate, to let them see your greatness and find the greatness in them so you get the most value out of the relationship.

This can be seen as the why you are selling to them, but clearer to me is hiring clients.

I am assuming you have used one or more internet services such as social media platforms, have an email account, probably have a hosting service for your website, use a cloud service to backup your digital stuff. Or in your phone, you use many services such as geolocation, messaging, and some app that helps your main income-producing activities such as calendars, blueprint viewers, and so on. When using any of these services, you first need to agree on their “terms and conditions,” meaning, they are actually stating very clearly how their customers or users must behave when using their product and services. Any violation of these terms makes the contract void, and they are free to block you from using their products. This is hiring clients in a nutshell.

Hiring clients is about being specific on who you want to serve and why. It’s beyond some demographic elements, but more behavioral. Say you are selling dog products. One can be very specific and even target a specific breed, but not necessarily. What’s a must is doing something like, “we serve people who care for their dog as a family member, because we know that not all family is blood-bound and we understand what it means to create good memories with your happy and healthy dog—our products are for people like yourself who want to protect your companion’s health, nature, and beauty.” This last part is your proposition hypothesis.

If the client does not relate to those values, then they are not a good fit for being your customer. They will probably argue that your pricing isn’t as good as Walmart’s, and for good reason. They are right, and you should validate that if they object. They just want a cheap toy and don’t care very much if the toy itself is good for their teeth, has approved materials and paints, and so on. Don’t be shy when telling who you serve the best, but also don’t shoot yourself in the foot if you are way too specific that there is no way you can easily grow. Focus on the main traits that many clients have.

It is as important to qualify as to disqualify. Clearly state who aren’t a good fit for being your client, the same way you would do it for an employee. This way, when you market to them, your hired clients will care for your messages and offers.
A note between the difference between clients and customers
However, not all businesses will be like that.

Many businesses do not actually care about hiring clients. They are more transactional, say a gas station in the middle of a road to somewhere far away from home. They don’t care about values; they are just there to help the drivers who need a pit stop to gas up, stretch their legs, go to a toilet, and have a snack. Maybe buy a local souvenir too.
They care about customers. Their values are more situational. It’s more about service guarantees such as having fast shipping, secure payment methods, good product selection, convenience, or pricing. One of the largest e-commerce sites should come to mind here.
A client implies loyalty because it’s rooted in a relationship. But a customer becomes a repeat customer if your proposition is consistent. However, customers are less loyal just because they get bored, get bad service, or simply find a better deal elsewhere. That’s why having restaurants is a tough business to be in. Many people like going to different places for fun, and some like to go to the same one because they’re treated well and they like the place, and probably it is convenient (near the office or home).

When saying client, think of a client of a lawyer. The lawyer will care for the specific needs of their client. They have their best interest in heart. There is a relationship. The relationship is based upon trust of the lawyer being competent at their thing and the client being able to afford the situation to reap the fruits of their lasting relationship. The strategy of preeminence, a strategy about leadership in the market, is all about caring about your clients so you are ahead of their issues, making the relationship all the more enjoyable for them. It doesn’t have to be expensive, but it needs to feel personal to some level. A lot of status-driven businesses follow this vision such as Premium brands, luxury items, and whatever businesses find a lot of value in nurturing trust. Now the tricky part. You don’t need to go deep on knowing everyone 1-on-1 deeply, but you should know their name and contact at least for your marketing communications, and somehow make them feel cared for. You can add to the history by collecting payment history information, product purchases, and any other marketing program you might be running. CRM, a software category, helps to collect this information. There are a few types of CRM, those who help create and manage websites, those who cater to create client profiles salespeople and service people use to follow-up and service, and those that help with data analytics. You can use any combination or type of CRM, depending on the vendor you like.

When saying customer, think more transactional. You don’t know much about them personally but as a group. You might, though, but the relationship is about knowing more about them to better market to them, not to develop a one-on-one relationship. Let’s just say it’s another kind of relationship based on them liking a brand. Think of Coca-Cola drinkers, they have their own relationship with the brand, but the brand doesn’t know much about them as an individual, but as a group. That reflects in their commercials and how the products are marketed (sizes, version, flavors, drink types, and places). CRMs also help here, as analytics type help understand better sales by dimensions, such as geography, product type, source of sale, payment type, and acquisition channel.

Companies that develop customers usually scale much more easily than companies that have clients. The learned buyer demographics of a customer base may be replicated in other geographies, regional, national, or international. The company then advertises to these new regions and horizontally grows. Depending on the business model, meaning how easy it is to capture these new customer bases, this kind of growth is the lowest hanging fruit for many organizations. Some exceptions to this may be franchises, dealing with heavy and distinct local regulations, and individual services. Note that I said, “may be,” because we cannot generalize. Not all franchises are resource-heavy investments, nor not all products may be subject to too much regulation scrutiny, nor not all individual services may require physical presence, for example.
