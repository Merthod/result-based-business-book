# 8. The Curious Case of Innovation in a Business

I’ll be blunt. Many businesses of all sizes do innovation wrong. And I could arguably say the same about marketing, but that’s another story.

As we saw earlier, Peter Drucker, a management guru, once said that the only two business activities that produce results are marketing and innovation. However, many businesses see innovation as extraneous to their ongoing operations, and there is no process at all to develop it. So, for them, it’s hard to see how innovation produces results.
First, what results does innovation provide? In the chapter, "Why grow a business?", I shared some risks businesses face when being in the market. Some of these are that demand can change and that competitors can introduce a better product. Innovation is about introducing new products or improving existing ones to adapt to the latest changes in the PESTEL acronym: political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal.

Moreover, innovation is not just about products. It can also streamline processes, reduce costs, and improve customer experiences. Innovation can even create new markets or disrupt existing ones, providing businesses with a competitive edge and ensuring their long-term survival.

In the 1970s, an OPEC oil embargo spiked gas prices, so the federal government created policies intended to reduce energy demand. One such policy was the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, which set thresholds on fuel economy that carmakers' vehicles must meet. However, instead of creating a single threshold, they created two: one for passenger cars, such as sedans and station wagons, and a more lenient standard for “light trucks”, including pickups and SUVs. In 1982, for example, the CAFE standard for passenger cars was 24 mpg, and only 17.5 mpg for light trucks.

Ford and other American brands invested heavily in SUVs and pickups because legally, they could be less efficient than cars, skipping some expensive regulations, so more profits. Thus, they pushed their SUVs and pickups hard. Ford even dropped manufacturing cars altogether, except for the Mustang, their insignia car.

Also, in countries like mine, Mexico, pickups can be 100% written off, so that is also an incentive for why having a pickup that has all the comforts of a nice car. If the car is necessary for my business doings and I can write it off 100%, meaning I keep more of my profits, then I might incline myself to have one.

Going further in the PESTEL analysis of the car business, American manufacturers know that Americans prefer driving large cars, which is also a plus for SUVs and trucks. Sadly, larger cars are also prone to more accidents, which in the U.S. has been on a steady rise in fatalities among pedestrians and cyclists. Since in a larger car, they’re harder to spot, the manufacturer adds technology to help identify them through sensors put in key spots around the vehicle’s perimeter.

Think of the intense competition in the car industry. Many brands make cars aiming for the same buyers, and they also add new features to their cars each year to keep them on the edge and potential buyers see more value in one brand than another. As my personal view, I don’t like having an expensive car with tons of features I don’t really want, like dozens of sensors making each part many times more expensive than a basic part, such as a taillight that has proximity sensors and a camera. But according to these manufacturers, a lot of buyers do. Some of these technology features become regulated requirements, others are safety features, and many others are simply nice-to-have features. Big vehicles create their own problems, which creates opportunities to make them more costly with such safety features.

Then you also have government incentives for the electric vehicle (EV) category. Tax breaks and even free electricity help convince consumer innovators to invest in it regardless of the inconveniences EVs introduce, like waiting hours to get a full charge and the problems EVs have had in cold weather.

The consumer innovator typically exists in the technology space in any market and refers mainly to wealthy people who like to be on the edge, assuming the higher costs of partly untested products, higher costs of the innovation itself (or lack of an economy of scale), and some inconvenience innovation brings, such as limited repairs, services, and the uncertainty of whether the innovation will eventually become mainstream.

If they’re business buyers, they buy into the new chic management software, such as the JIRA project management system for their software developers, with its accompanying SCRUM certifications for their project managers. Or they buy the latest scanning and tracking solution to automate inventory traffic for large warehouses, with the promise of having zero errors and immediate feedback so the salespeople don’t have to make backorders for inventory their non-real-time system shows it still existed, frustrating buyers.

If they’re personal buyers, they feel attracted to the most current smartphone and smartwatch with the most cutting-edge features, the new EV, maybe even home automation gear, and any other innovative produce they see themselves using or collecting.

However, you must know that this segment is tiny compared to the mainstream. According to the “diffusion of innovation” theory, it’s about 2.5% of the market. I have to say that this theory, still widely cited today, originated in 1962, so this number must be taken with a grain of salt since a “diffusion” would be hard to measure and the nature of the many markets that technology have touched have changed a lot since. From the primitive use of email to immediately communicate an idea to the latest robot on wheels that helps customers in a large store that knows how to empathetically communicate with a human-like voice and direct them to their searched product.

So, innovation as a market is small. Why invest in improving product or services then? Not all products are prone for innovation, but many are. Furthermore, innovation can touch not only the final product you sell, but also the process to make it, ship it and service it, helping reduce costs and improve sales at the same time.

## Innovation culture

The problem usually relies on how the company promoted innovation. What happens when a manager or an employee thinks about a new idea?
Continuing with the war-like analogies from the “Why grow a business?” chapter, during peacetime or during the time you’re the dominant market leader, the emphasis on innovation usually is on process, procedures and the sustainment of existing systems. Deviation from that may create chaos, not welcomed, let alone not promoted and not funded in most organizations. This works great when the external environment – competitors, adversaries, technologies, other threats – are static. However, in times of war, crisis or disruption, the unconventional thinkers, those who like to test new ideas is exactly what the organization needs, and their ideas need to be rapidly tested and deployed.
Well-managed organization know they need both innovation and execution. Execution is dominant during peacetime, or when you have a competitive advantage. Then you have “managers of process”. In wartime or crisis, innovation is dominant. Instead of managers you need innovation leaders who shepherd ideas through an innovation pipeline. What you need to take away here is understanding that innovation isn’t a single activity where someone suggests a nice new idea and becomes a “hero” that receives a paper recognition and a coupon for a milkshake. Innovation must be a process, just as marketing is too.
Only that academics like to call the innovation process, a “pipeline”. So, having an incubator, accelerator or a hackathon isn’t enough to integrate innovation in your business. Innovation needs to be an end-to-end process that structures from the idea to its deployment.
Peter Drucker helped us with defining a basic innovation process in his writings.

## An innovation process

Let’s outline the original innovation process Drucker proposed.

1. Idea generation. The organization asks stakeholders, like employees, suppliers and buyers, ideas about new products, services, processes or business models. When a company talks about synergy, it talks about this, how does different entities, like buyer-you or you-supplier, can improve the status quo.
   External observation helps here too. Looking at what other companies, directly related to yours or not, are doing can help break the glass ceiling.
2. Idea screening. Once you have a pool of ideas, screening is needed to sort them by their feasibility, alignment with strategic goals and potential impact. Those that pass go to the next step.
3. Concept development. In this stage, the organization outline the details of the selected ideas to create a description. How will the solution work? What benefits will it have? Who’s the winner of its execution?
4. Business case development. Now the concept is elevated to a business plan. Here we plan for resources, go-to-market and its financing. This will help high management, probably yourself, what concepts are viable and whether going forward.
5. Prototype development. When the business case is approved, now the organization builds one or more prototypes to test and validate the concept. This may be user testing, a pilot project or any other forms to test the concept.
6. Commercialization. The final stage, the organization launches the new product, service, or business model into the market. Now it gets fully integrated into the business plan with its marketing, sales, distribution and support.
   This is very similar to a marketing process, since in marketing you test the marketing mix including channels, messaging, products and distributions, to find what works and then invest heavily on it.
   The challenge many managers have is creating a culture that promotes innovative thinking and is willing to allocate some of the employee’s working time to develop these ideas.
   There’s also the challenge that employees may have developed complacency about how they do their job. Humans don’t like change, and unless the organization is in “war mode” or “survival mode”, as described earlier, it’s hard to sell and get on board the idea of change.
   One extra challenge arises when an idea directly threatens a main profit center. Here we have the classical examples of streaming video (Netflix) versus renting video cassettes (Blockbuster), or printing pictures (Kodak, Polaroid) versus having a digital camera and then the smartphone. Some businesses simply reject these ideas and hide them under the rug. Naturally, other businesses will be following soon. As science history has always taught us, any development breakthrough is likely being researched at least at two distinct places almost at the same time. We are too many people to realistically believe that our ideas are unique. Some business leaders have stated that they live conscious of the threat that their business can be threatened by almost anyone at any time. Usually, big innovators come from outside an industry. And also, many organizations pivot from one space to another when the opportunity arises. It’s easier to understand this when you see that an organization, led by humans, is basically a human, or humanoid, that has similar behaviors. That’s why corporations are given the status of a member of society, albeit faceless.
   It's important to note the role of leadership and its ideals on this topic, because Netflix once offered itself to Blockbuster at a bargain, and they didn’t want it. Even in the social media revolution of the 2000s, Facebook offered itself to MySpace, then the giant, and they also turned it down. In any case, whenever these offers happened, the environment wasn’t as clear as today. It was a risk. Adoption of the Internet wasn’t as universal as we see it today, without the smartphones or the smart TV existing yet and the Internet connection speeds slow for the average user, who also needed to be sitting in front of their PC. This picture didn’t look real for streaming movies nor using social media for an extended period of time in any given day. MySpace did sell itself to the media mogul Rupert Murdoch in 2005, who clearly didn’t know what to do with it and later sold it for just 6% ($35 million) of what he paid for it ($580 million.)
   Innovation bears the “big risk, big rewards” principle. However, not all innovations need to be “disruptive”, or change an entire industry. We have already said that it may simply mean a new process, a new product or a new way to deliver a product. Big innovations do bear high rewards, so there’s a lot of excitement when someone steps into this playing field. Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center), a research division of Xerox, the copying machine company, did step on it a few times, by pioneering the graphical user interface, the mouse, ethernet and the laser printer, and 0didn’t commercialize any of them successfully. It was others, famously Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, who did it. Disruptive innovation is the lesser of all feasible innovations, by number.
   In the simplest terms, innovation is modernization of process. Consider a lenient definition of process. A process of product, the product itself from creation to distribution. A process of work, relating to efficiency and effectiveness. The process of risk, or how to minimize financial, investment, resource allocating risk or time of delivery risk. A service process to streamline support tickets and improve retention at a standard and premium quality. And so on.
   There are a bunch of methodologies, or frameworks, available to validate innovation ideas, especially towards technology, since it is the richest source of innovation.

## Frameworks to validate innovation ideas

### Technology Readiness Level (TRL).

It’s a framework developed by NASA. It uses a scale ranging from 1 to 9 that measures the level of technical maturity of a particular technology. The lower it is, the more conceptual it is and the higher it is, the more ready it is for deployment in the real world. This can help prioritize investments.
For instance, if some part of a product or a manufacturing technique is untested, we can asses the reliability before committing substantial resources.
Consider that this scale helps clearly communicate risks to other stakeholders that might not be familiar to the technologies or methodologies in question.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

This is a lean startup methodology that involved developing a basic version of a product or service with just enough features to satisfy initial customers and provide feedback for future iterations. By stapling a MVP together quickly, organizations can gather data and learn about user behavior, preferences and pain points without fully committing to the product itself.
This is a popular methodology that also ties to the flywheel principle that suggests that as more momentum the product gets, the more attraction it has that can be leveraged in a variety of ways, such as easier adoption through the innovative reputation, loyalty and word-of-mouth referrals, or developing switching costs (make it expensive and time-consuming to change to another solution), and even attracting investments, talent and partnerships.

The MVP is a highly popular framework to develop new products while minimizing risk. However, it is not without its asterisks that have made practitioners suggest improvements. We’ll discuss it later.

Use this if you are unsure about the viability of an idea and consumer demand. Develop an MVP and learn from its initial users to create a better, more sensible, product that may scale, or pivot elsewhere by learning where demand is really going.

### Design thinking.

Design thinking is a holistic approach to innovation that focuses on empathizing with users, defining their needs, ideating solutions, prototyping and testing. Here we involve end-users throughout the innovation process, so you develop products that address their needs and desires.

This approach is good if you’re faced with a complex multifaceted problem. In contrast with a MVP, where you progressively learn what users want, here you want to go deep as quickly as possible to their needs and behaviors.

Many successful startups have used this methodology to build innovative solutions, such as Airbnb so people save on hotels by renting a free room in someone’s house. Naturally this business model has evolved since its initial conception, but here we focus in that initial product. Apple did it by its radical focus on the easy to use and stylish computer. Netflix to develop its initial streaming service in contrast to their cassette mailing service. UberEats to revolutionize the food delivery business leveraging their existing user base. Or Nike by letting professional athletes help design their shoes both in functionality and design.

### Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD).

JTBD focuses on identifying the underlying tasks or jobs that buyers want to accomplish. It’s basically selling to the customer’s final user or use.

It’s well represented in a classic direct-response advertising guiding principle: people don’t want a quarter inch drill. They want a quarter inch hole.

The framework helps businesses to find what’s the resonating factor that makes people buy the product. It’s often emotional.
It is often done by interviewing buyers and clients (in case the buyer is a business) to learn more about their decisions and own customers. This can help a promising product with not so good sales find the hot buttons it needs to push, from simply better marketing to a whole new offering or new market that can tip the scale in your favor.

### Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DOI).

It divides the market through innovation phases over time, from the innovators and early adopters, to the majority and late adopters. Any innovative product will stop being innovative at some point.

In 2007, Steve Jobs announced the revolutionizing iPhone, a concept phone that found immediate success and that many other phone manufacturers started imitating. 20 years later, the iPhone still exists and fuel a lot of Apple’s sales, but hardly can it be considered innovative anymore. The iPhone has found its maturity and it shows since they have categorized their market to maximize sales through different models. A product’s maturity can be long-lived until a disruptive innovation comes around that may threaten it. Not all products fall to this curve. A water bucket hasn’t changed in decades, and the concept is still the same for centuries. Also, the bicycle has changed little over the decades. An electric motorized bicycle has been introduced, but it has failed to cross the “chasm” of innovation that takes it from a few early adopters to the majority mass market, since the majority of users don’t have a motorized bicycle and probably never will. Consider that the motorized electrical bicycles have been developed at least since 1985, with many more attempts going on since the 2000s.

## Who can innovate?

In principle, anyone in the organization is a potential innovator.
Since innovation starts by understanding the market, the frontline employees are the most obvious start in the process. However, they need guidance to develop innovative ideas, especially since they’re probably complacent with following established processes and not catching the eye of the supervisors.
The “what’s in it for me?” principle.

Any stakeholder, from buyers to employees, mostly only care about themselves. That’s why we give medals to people who get out of their own way to help others. That’s rarity.

Developing innovators comes from recruiting to training about its process and how the organization treats innovation ideas. As we said before, innovation spurs mostly when the organization is in crisis. Take the iconic and dubious story of Richard Montañez, the janitor turned executive at Pepsi Co. who claimed inventing the Flamin’ Hot Cheetos after understanding how the Mexican consumers liked hot and not sweet snacks that became their best-selling and probably still are. He is an innovation hero, which isn’t great news for a corporate culture such as Pepsi’s. Richard’s curiosity and drive to be “something more” than a janitor pushed him to pay attention and develop some business skills that helped make the product a success.

Motivation never comes from the outside. It’s in the word itself. Motivation comes from motion with a purpose, and motion comes from the inside. We can inspire, teach and push people to go beyond, but if they don’t find purpose and move towards it themselves, nothing will happen. Nothing will be ignited. Nothing will change. That’s why to develop an innovative culture you need curious people who naturally question the status quo and look for improvements in any place they can find it. But can there be too much curiosity that makes it more difficult to manage? It depends on what type of behavior you want to induce given the circumstances. When a company boasts about being diverse, it is a good idea that it is diverse on age, life experiences, backgrounds and cultures. I can’t see how innovation can spur from a bunch of people who had mostly similar life experiences and think similarly, which is an inhibitor of motivation to change and challenge the status quo. Richard Montañez may or may not invent the Flamin’ Hot Cheetos, but he did help make them a smashing success, and his background wasn’t that of a typical Pepsi’s executive hire.

Innovation ideas shouldn’t be bound to organization hierarchies. An innovation idea shouldn’t be sanctioned by an immediate boss or supervisor and then go up through some sort of funnel. Idea generation should be an open forum where leadership can see them all directly to remove red tape and internal politics that may constrain the effort. Since it is much easier that a company has a toxic culture than a sane one, it helps than innovation is accessible for everyone and anyone at any given time without censorship nor judgement.

You should also understand that a typical employee isn’t an entrepreneur nor has entrepreneurial drive. They are typically driven by the low hanging fruit, or the law of minimum effort, unless there is a perceived achievable incentive of growth within the company. Innovation exercises may need some sort of incentive and guidance.

Just as happens with salespeople, originator and implementors good innovative projects should be rewarded of attaining the project’s objectives, and this may motivate anyone and their cousin to be part of the group. How to reward? Just as with sales, there are different approaches. Experience suggests not to give cash money but anything else, from a nice meal, to a trip, to shares, to a degree to a job. The problem with cash rewards is that is taxable and its effect doesn’t last nor is memorable. Cash prizes are liked because they’re usually used to pay debts. Using the cash just to pay a debt is hardly a memorable thing if a new debt is just going to appear soon because they happen to manage money bad. You may give the choice, maybe as a bonus, but remember that innovation rewards shouldn’t be because a person becomes an innovation hero, but because an innovation was successfully implemented and shows tangible results beneficial to the business. Having the innovation originator be involved in the whole process is highly enriching for their curriculum.

Since people naturally reject change and even if they don’t, they often don’t feel empowered or capable of provoking change to a system, guidance is a good thing. A facilitator enables to seed and nurture ideas until they sprout into a workable project that’s considered and prioritized by top management just as we saw before in the innovation process.
Innovation is a fun area where anyone can be a part of, regardless of hierarchy, education and status position. It’s paramount that you (or management) effectively communicate and invite anyone to join. Innovation can help launch careers, pivot or find pleasure outside their normal job. In any case, management is required because innovation must happen within office hours.

Innovation can create new businesses, create cost efficiencies, and improve the overall service and buying experience, reducing errors, making it easier, decentralize it, better manage or supervise something, create new products, find new markets, find new uses, synergize with third parties, improve parts of the overall supply chain, so the reward should be proportional to the business impact it creates. Like in the case of Richard Montañez, since he helped establish the success of the product, it was logical to make him manage it and improve it so he eventually became a vice president of multicultural sales.

Many businesses create this innovation guidance as an “innovation lab”, a safe space where training, guidance and tools are facilitated to develop new projects. Whatever happens in the innovation lab shouldn’t affect whatsoever all outside job. The issue here is that people apart from naturally rejecting change, they too don’t like to be seen as stupid, ignorant or limited in the workplace, so that’s why you need a safe space that don’t relate the ongoing responsibilities to an innovation attempt. The facilitator should have an idea too better compensate those limitations to make the project successful. It may be integrating another person whose skills are relevant, bringing external help or maybe even completely delegate to a third-party expert.

About allocating time, some companies devote one hour a week to generate ideas, which include noticing problems to address like bottlenecks, inefficiencies, changes in the industry or related industries and other PESTEL (political, economic, social, technology, environment and legal) issues.

For instance, an accountant may suggest what kind of investments and purchases are incentivized by tax cuts or write-offs, opportunities to access low-interest state financing. Then an employee from procurement may suggest investing in a supplier that’s investing in technology, where the business may eventually end up buying the whole business eventually. A marketer may then inform about changes in consumer behavior and how buying cycles within the business are overall too slow, so probably that technology may help the business to better service purchases, creating efficiencies that allow a significant market share expansion by promoting how the business quickly and efficiently service orders. Then a web developer might share what other players are doing in the field through his research and they discover a few generalized pain points. Surprisingly, all use salespeople and so, all websites require to phone a sales representative. They called a few, and not in every business the call got in easily. The developer then suggests that it shouldn’t be hard to automate purchases within the website. The marketer gets on board, self-service would help, and let only sales representative help big buyers. That would help scale easier. However, purchases in website usually require to enter the credit or debit card information, and almost all of the buyers do bank transfers. No worries, says the developer. The order can be created with an expiration date, and ask for the transfer, just as they do with a normal sale. Now they can replace a bunch of expensive sales people with some more affordable service employees that monitors all paid orders generated by the system and service them quickly. There’s a project born to be tested. The accountant says there shouldn’t be any problem financing this since the project would incur in actual savings, so no extra loans needed.

It is important to have an innovation playbook, an innovation doctrine based on threat assumptions that others might phase you out somehow and an ideology that innovation is paramount to lasting success. Finally, everyone needs to know their role and expectations during peace time and war time.

Preparedness is the best defense.
