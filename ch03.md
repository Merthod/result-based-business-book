# 3. A Strategic Vision of Selling

Selling is much more than simply presenting a product and getting a close.

We could say that this is the most basic and contained vision of selling, and crucially important, too. Without closing, we don’t get any income after all.

Businesses have developed and optimized selling processes to streamline their income-generating activities, their offerings, and payment collection into a strategy that produces a domino effect.

Bear in mind that these processes are somewhat unique to every business, although looking from the outside they may seem similar.

The classical process of selling involves:

1. Qualification
2. Presentation
3. Consideration
4. Closing

Qualification is by far the most important step in this process and it works before you even actively try to sell anything. Some may argue that qualification is up to 75% of the sale.

Consider most of your everyday purchases. The brands or even salespeople don’t have to do much to convince you of anything, you already come with the intent to buy, and the brand or salespeople, sort of a waiter, simply suggest some product or current promotion maybe, an upsell with a nice upside for you, and then takes and manages the order. If you have a good relationship, they may even give you credit so you don’t have to pay up immediately but prorated within a few months.

This is the power of relationships. All relationships are qualified. Take a love interest or a good friend for an easy example to understand its value. First, you found out some commonalities, then you found something interesting about them that keeps you coming back to them, and then the relationship kept growing by sharing experiences. It is not that different with a business or brand. You find something there that you like. Maybe their prices resonate with your window of spending. Maybe they look knowledgeable or more passionate than you, which boosts your confidence with them. Maybe you find some common history, like that’s the brand that your parents bought, or in the business world, that’s the brand that all the powerhouses in the space have. Then you start buying and you like it, you find the brand interesting because it’s easy to get, or they bring status, or convenience or something different you don’t easily find in others. And so, you have a relationship.

Relationships don’t need to be about human contact, but they need to feel human. That’s also why people who have never met fall in love online. Brands need to do something similar. Maybe not make people “fall in love” with them, but they need to elicit some sort of fascination. The most basic and probably also most effective way is through edutainment. That is, businesses show how they do what they do and share some inside track that helps attract and qualify people.

## Qualification

Qualification works by people relating to an image of who the business is serving. It’s people metaphorically raising their hand and saying, “come here and take my money, waiter”. Although qualification doesn’t get the sale, a good qualification process already does a lot in opening the wallet since it primes people to buy something. It just doesn’t have made the person take out the money from it, yet.

The best way to qualify people is by talking to them by name. It’s saying, “hey Martha, I made this for you!”

However, most of the time we don’t get to use names, especially from people who haven’t already bought from us. So, what’s the next best thing?

The next best thing is whatever words distribution platforms (like ad networks or social media) or people themselves use to self-categorize them. They may be investors, housewives, car salespeople, viewers of X YT channel, Googlers, people who like classical piano music, travel nomads, people over 40 making 120k a year or more in Southern California, Ford Mustang owners, and so on.

Calling this niche out in the headline helps people “raise their hands” and interrupt them. They now know that the message is targeted to them. Now it is a numbers game. Usually, the headline or lede (opening sentence) should be a combination of qualifying an audience by name and a promise or problem that will make people give you their attention.

Even if you find your audience and promise universally appealing, numbers show us that when you add something specific, such as a town name, reflecting a local lifestyle and local images. Qualification needs to be as specific as you can. The internet helps us by letting us use variables, such as headlines with placeholders to put the name of the town automatically depending on where an ad is served so it’s quite easy to do so, even on your website if you want. However, savvy marketers prefer using local-sounding domain names (.com) plus clones of content websites with those domains so the message is a little more generic, but still has the local appeal because of the website name. Maybe I’m running too deep with the example. You don’t need to do exactly this, but this is a popular stratagem used in political marketing to appeal to dividing political opinions, you create the local leftist opinion and the local rightist opinion and benefit from both, why not?

The lesson here is always call out somehow to are you talking to and then why should they listen to you.

## Presentation

Now we are talking about the nitty-gritty of the art of selling.

Say your lede was a simple promise: “Stop your divorce.”

These three words, much like the alleged shortest story of all time of Hemingway’s “Baby shoes for sale. Never worn.”, say a lot by themselves. “Stop your divorce” implies two important things:

1. The message is for married people.

2. At least one of them doesn’t want to get divorced.

You can add a “.com” to that title and get a wildly successful sales page. Usually, a sales page will present their information in an emotional way by using a sales copywriting formula.

One really big one is Problem-Agitate-Resolve.

Present the problem so the reader relates to it.

Then show how people mess it up and probably make it worse by failing to fix it on their own and showing how expensive it is not resolving it adding up the ongoing frustrations. It can be expensive in emotional energy, time, and money already spent and those expenses continuing piling up. A bad marriage emotionally drains the person who wants to make it work. That’s knowing your audience for you.

During the presentation, you want to do these three things:

• Elaborate on the promise you made to being an audience during qualification. What is the product? How does it work? Why should they believe you? Is it easy to use? What is it needed to make it work?

• Show proof. Screenshots, testimonials, a demonstration, a case study or even a story.

• Highlight the unique mechanism or big idea behind your offering and make it results oriented. If in a competitive field, you need to highlight the mechanism that makes your product unique. Take the smartphone battle, some highlight the powerful camera, others the entertainment experience with stereo sound, others their innovative design, and so on.

You may present a list of features and benefits depending on the format of the message. A strong copywriting tip to do it effectively is doing it curiosity driven. One famous one in the electronics world was said by Steve Jobs when he introduced the iPod as “One thousand songs in your pocket” and with the iPhone as “an iPod, a web browser and a phone in one.” You can then highlight the design, how can it be securely used with the various street and weather conditions and even dance with it without it breaking down, battery durability to enjoy a full day of non-stop music, and so on.

I won’t delve too much into copywriting because these days you can ask an AI agent to do it for you. Don’t be shy if you want to edit whatever it gives you. Just be sure that the AI knows the audience profile it is crafting copy for so it adopts an adequate prose and context so copy is best understood.

## Consideration

Consideration is where the bargaining starts.

This is the point where you present the price point and the reader starts scaling the balance between the price paid and the value they will get from your produce.

You need that the scale always shows that value is more than the asking price. If it’s not felt nor understood, objections will start to pile up.

When asking for consideration, make sure that:

• Have a unique selling proposition.

• Have a strong offering that can stand on its own feet when compared to rivals.

• The offering is communicated crystal clear.

• Have a value stack if needed (especially if there is strong competition). A value stack is adding some timely bonuses so value is seen larger and larger. Test whether if exaggerating the value works. Some marketers have a “get a $2,000 deal for $197” value stack piling the main product with many bonuses, and it might work, or not.

• Add some urgency and scarcity. One cannot stress strong enough how important urgency and scarcity are to make people act now. One effective way to do it is to limit your bonuses, but sometimes even a random countdown timer might do the trick. In any case, don’t abuse the intelligence of your audience. Make the buying experience fun.

• Add negotiation points. You need to understand who you are selling to. Is the price point high for them? Is it level? Can you test some pricing alternatives? Add some payment plans? Test one time-payment versus a recurring plan? Can buying X give them benefits to get Y? Can you remove all perceived risk from the purchaser perspective? You can use analogy to effectively communicate price, like comparing it to Starbucks coffees, movie tickets or a trip to a popular local site. Again, make sure the messaging resonates with them. Consider how many hours do they have to work on average to get to afford your offering so you get a stronger bargaining perspective.

During consideration, it is recommended that you have some level of tracking, from having them get an account to use remarketing to change the offer if they just leave your website. If you are doing online selling efforts, such as having a video sales page, track how much of the video they seen to remarket, or remarket to the people who added products to a shopping basket.

You can get to the next level if you manage to have some contact information, like an email or a phone number to do SMS, so you can follow-up in case the selling process is interrupted.

## Closing

Closing is the part of the sales process where the deal is sealed.

Amazon did a brilliant job in its early days by “inventing” the “1-click checkout”, where with a single, easy click, the sale could be closed right away. They patented it, but it expired years ago for everyone to do.

It is commonly understood between salespeople that the better job you do in the first stages, the closing stage gets easier. If you struggle during closing, usually you need to go back to a prior stage and circle back. The close is to close, not to bargain.

During the closing stage, you need to “sign the contract” and pay. It also includes the nice onboarding experience that happens immediately after the payment is done.

It is not often said, and probably many marketers don’t even consider this in the closing stage, but you need to make sure the sale stick. It is common that a buyer regrets their decision. Send an onboarding email, or link them to a video, or send them a video through some messaging app, or include the sales page or sales page review so they don’t forget why they bought.

If your product is innovative in a meaningful way, consider that the unfamiliarity can trigger purchase regret emotions, so have a readily available documentation and/or help desk to help them sort things through, from configuring stuff, to guide them on the first steps to do whatever. There are many ways to tackle this. The important thing is to do it, so you reduce refunds to a bare minimum. One cannot overstate the emotion of shame of customers feeling dumb of not being able to use the product properly and its effect on returns. It’s important to address this fear sooner than later.

Finally, ask for the sale. Ask to buy now. Don’t be shy about it. Don’t be too wordy about it. Just say it and close the sale.

## Selling doesn’t stop after you close

We have said before that a business is born when a sale is made. But a strategic business is made after the second sale is made.

This means, you design a process that takes the buyer to the second sale.

If you close a second sale, the chances of that buyer become a regular buyer is much higher than after just buying once. You need to start a second selling process after you close the first one. Now you have the previous purchase plus whatever other information you had before to qualify them.

A car dealership is a good example, because for an average financing buyer, they sell the car plus the financing terms, so there’s two profits to be made, one for the car itself, and the other for the collected interest from the financing plan. There may even be a third if they include insurance, too. It is easy to see why car dealerships like to do financing too, because it converts one sale into a recurring finite sale. A one $45,000 payment can be a 60-month $800 recurring income, which benefits the business in many ways.

First, is spreads income into many months, giving the business some tax advantages when needing to write off expenses against its recurring income. Second, it makes the business much more predictable, which in turn makes it more valuable. Its valuation can be twice or more of a business that simply sells cars by the sticker price without options. In such cases, buyers may get their own financing if needed through their own bank.

In a psychologic level, one could argue that it’s better to make a person used to giving you money. This will have a positive impact after you need to raise prices and get more loyalty from them.ñ

To develop a larger process effectively, we must talk beyond sales. Since sales happens when you’re ready to close, and not everyone is ready to be closed at any time. This is where marketing enters.

Marketing includes everything you need from create a product, bring in an audience for it, selling it, distribute it and keep nurturing the relationship somehow so buyers keep returning.
