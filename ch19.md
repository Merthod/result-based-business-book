### 19. The Thin Line of Deceptive Marketing

In the game of chess, there are concise and concrete rules of how to win, lose, or draw. The forcing winning move is the checkmating move, and the non-forcing winning move is whatever makes it obvious the game is one-sided straight to an eventual checkmate, like in having too much material advantage plus the initiative.

Furthermore, the pieces are all laid out on the chessboard. It’s perfect information. There are no “spies,” or hidden pieces anywhere, nor traitors, nor do the rules change midgame and one to all pieces now behaves differently or there is some random disqualification or cheats. What allows a player to win is their own ability to exploit mistakes from their rival and create advantages of their own, or how they make their understanding of the game a victory.

We could argue that the game of chess is one of high ethics where both players are conscious of the rules and bound by them.

The game of business is different. There are some rules laid out, like the rules of accounting, lean production, and other laws and regulations each industry and business are subjected to. But first, there are simply too many rules for every player to know, and second, there is imperfect information too. There are “unwritten” rules for the game of business that make some win much more than others. Besides the unwritten rules, in contrast with chess, it’s now a one versus one game. Each player is counseled and advised by their inner circle of trusted people, and also may be part of exclusive communities that offer timely information, insights, and other advantages that make it easier for them to win in business.

Plus, who wins in business? The ones who make a profit? The ones who become leaders in their category? The ones that sustain a business long-term, despite it being profitable?

A cunning businessman can rely only on their intuition, which is trained through experience and open-mindedness. But this challenges directly the high ethics of the game of chess, since a person who mostly relies only on their intuition can easily cheat and get away with it.

Ideally, one would have high ethics, which is driven by making constructive decisions based on both consciousness and intuition. But there’s also low ethics, which are destructive decisions also based on both consciousness and intuition. Now the key here is constructive for us, and destructive for others.

There are three layers of businessmen: the true capitalists, the investors, and the survivors.

**A. Fundamental Capitalists**

These are a very select amount of people that concentrate most of the world’s private capital and have direct influence in central banking and nation-wide monopolistic enterprises, and thus, control their economies to a certain extent. Sometimes they don’t own but do control state public capital, like mining concessions and privatizations that benefit from large public subsidies and tax advantages. These people can easily finance corrupt governments and sink them into large debt while accumulating control for themselves. These people arguably use low ethics since they are mostly driven by greed while using the caring-for-the-world mask and so, they push their capitalist ideas to the world, that benefit to some extent the people (thus they’re accepted), and benefit a lot themselves.

**B. The Investors**

These are businesspeople who know the rules of the game, both those written and unwritten. These are professionals that know what they’re doing and can make a business succeed in a capitalist environment if the conditions are right. It is well-known that the best entrepreneurs also think as investors and thus, make decisions that are good for the business long-term, are strategic in their approaches and finally, allow them to accumulate wealth. Most professional entrepreneurs who can grow a business are here. Investors justify themselves on just knowing the game, so they detach themselves emotionally from the controversial decisions they might take, like hiring employees just to keep them off the competition or firing them because of an organizational restructure independent of their performance. They can also have higher ethics, managing and growing their business responsibly and giving back to the community. Investors may or may not be conscious of what the fundamental capitalists do and invest accordingly.

**C. The Survivors**

These are people who may know the rules of the game but to a much lesser extent than an investor. Think mom & pop shops. They might know unwritten rules, like leveraging relationships to get contracts or having a great location, but not much else. Or they may know the written rules of the game like well-managing it, but not know or care about how to grow or scale it because they always are part of the workforce by being a manager. They focus on the short-term results and long-term thinking means, assuming the circumstances don’t change too much, they’ll survive. Survivors are more prone to failure as the business they control tend to directly depend on their inputs, including their own vision, self-limitations, and personal shortcomings, like being bad communicators, bad negotiators, and not caring enough about having a management system. They might be more extreme in their ethics than investors, either following rules strictly and managing their businesses professionally, or winging it as they go.

In many cases, businesses will adopt less than ideal ethics in their marketing and sales, partly justified, partly manipulative.

For instance, a salesperson might act busy or late for something and not care about the sale, even acting a little rude, because that ticks the buyer in the right way in most cases, and end up buying. It is a harmless sales tactic, but one could also argue it is manipulative.

This is learning through experience. A book may suggest being polite, understanding, and listening to the buyer, but a salesperson might find only frustration in doing so, being polite while people are being dismissive and rude to their face or act angry while narrating their previous experience to get a perk.

Buyers also wear their own masks and play dumb to see if they can get a better deal, while they’re already sold into the product. Or they may play smart-ass and thank them as they just received a better deal triggering the salesperson into conceding a discount or a bonus.

Sales and negotiation are a game where the one with the better information, strategy, tactics, and attitude around the sales situation (the product is only part of it), wins.

## Fun Products

When I was first learning about sales tactics many years ago, one example that caused an impression on me was the casino. The casino trades money for chips (gamification) so it is less psychologically straining to bet large amounts at the table. Casinos also don’t have windows so time is perceived differently. It is a business designed to make you spend a lot of money for as long as possible.

Would you say that’s manipulative? It certainly is! But casinos already have an established reputation and their methods are normalized in society. One could manifest against it in a public square claiming that it is dirty business and probably (not likely) make the government make the casino more transparent in their sales tactics.

Nevertheless, I find the originator of such ideas a creative mind. They certainly were marketing geniuses.

A mall arcade uses similar tactics. No windows, chips for money exchangeable for prizes that force players to win a lot to get them. Winning that cheap plushy is a lot more fun than simply buying it. That’s experience in marketing for you.

When a sought-after experience is affected by these subtle manipulations, we accept it and even justify it. A gambler might think that he does gamble “smarter” if they’re not handling money directly instead of chips.

Rationalizations are a key instrument to justify manipulation. People enjoy soda because it tastes so good, despite the excess of sugar; they just choose to ignore it. Some would say, “we have to die of something” and drink without any worry. Some people justify excessive overpricing of premium brand items and rationalize that “if you can afford it, you won’t complain.”

You can find rationalizations in about any kind of product and pricing. Rationalization is a defense mechanism in which we defend our many-times questionable decisions with (sometimes faulty) logic. Its emotional counterpart is bias disguised as excitement, one popular kind is the fear of missing out (and others are what we discussed in pricing such as exclusivity, scarcity, limited-time offers, social proof, etc.), or FOMO. Combined they’re dynamite!

Marketing messaging often leverages these faulty mental processes where the slogan is a cute rationalization. Beer might not be the best drink for your health, but it’s what friends drink when they’re having fun at a Sunday game. Alcohol and many addiction-inducing vices are acquired. Not many people found their first beer particularly tasty, but after a while, they started liking it. Then it becomes a drink for “developed tastes.”

## Dark Funnels

The ICPEN, or the International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network, found that A global internet sweep that examined the websites and mobile apps of 642 traders has found that 75.7% of them employed at least one dark pattern, and 66.8% of them employed two or more dark patterns.[^1]

Dark funnels are basically marketing funnels that use deceptive messaging, manipulative mechanisms, and dark patterns.

Let us discuss some common practices used in dark funnels.

### About Deceptive Messaging

- Sensational or clickbait headlines where the actual content has little to nothing to do with what the headline promises. Security software uses this kind of hooks with ads that say “6 vulnerabilities found in your computer” in red letters boxed in a dialog similar to a real system dialogue.
- Misleading calls-to-action. Saying “instant access” where the next page is just a trial, or a sales page.
- Fake discounts. Inflating the price so the “discounted” price is actually the normal price. Some pages with many flash sales actually do it using dark gamification. They give you “special discounts” because of your status (purchase history turned into points) but they are the same prices for everyone or the discounts too symbolic to look like a deal. But people operate on imperfect information and they don’t realize it, and even if they did, it’s easy to rationalize the low price in the first place.
- Hidden fees. The famous “free book, only pay shipping and ‘handling’.” Ironic that only free books usually have this “handling” fee.
- Fake scarcity. The products that are always almost sold-out, but never actually are.
- Fake trust badges. One popular case was paying to appear in some kind of directory of some recognizable publications, like Forbes, and then putting “featured in Forbes” and many others.
- Fake testimonials or reviews. Amazon has a problem in this regard. Many products with even thousands of reviews aren’t even from the product itself. Also known as “astroturfing.”
- Fake guarantees. Adding a “money-back guarantee” or “cancel any time” assurance message but there is actually an annoying cancellation process.
- Fake warranties. Putting messaging like “lifetime warranty” but the small letters actually say it’s only on certain parts.
- Fake and misleading endorsements. Putting “experts” or creating formal sounding events that aren’t real, like the “Harvard Senior Investment Society” to make the people behind a financial instrument look like insiders. Some even fake speaking videos of these makeshift organizations that are actually sales pitches.

### About Manipulative Mechanisms

- Masked affiliate links. Masking recommendations to external sales or product pages that give out a commission to the referrer if the visitor buys.
- Deceptive up-sells and cross-sales. Forcing upsells by pre-checked checkboxes or products that are only buyable via bundles.
- Fake bonuses. “Free” gift cards or other bonuses that are actually charged for. Usually also via pre-checked checkboxes and the subtotal not reflecting their cost.
- Free-trials mechanisms. Such as auto-charging after a certain time period or consumption.
- Low-value offers. Offering low-quality loss-leaders or “free” book that are reports that only sell another more expensive offer.
- Countdown timers. Whoops! We suggested this before.
- Misleading calls-to-action. Besides what was mentioned earlier, having the button assume acceptance for an offer or obscure terms and conditions.
- Hidden subscription renewals. Again, by using misleading calls-to-action.
- Fake limited-time-offers. Some stores have flash sales with an offer about to expire, only to reappear in the next cycle.
- Complex pricing, hidden fees, and abusive terms and conditions. Adobe is famous for this one for their Photoshop product where they basically force a year subscription and the early cancellation is basically the same as paying for the whole year. Amazon AWS has complex pricing that is hard to budget. Also hard to find cancellation links.
- Dark gamification. Giving away thousands of tokens, but they are actually worth very little, or making them hard to cash or only apply to their less appealing items. Also forcing sharing (recommending) something to access something. Adding too many (and likely convoluted) rules to win. Pay-to-win. Adding badges and status that don’t mean anything, like being a “superfan” after 3 visits to a fan page or posting a couple comments.

### About Dark Patterns

- Bait and switch. Having a desirable offer attract people, but it is unavailable and so you offer something else. Also showing a price and then adding costs after commitment. Also doing a test to find something only to be pushed to an affiliate offer.
- Free-trial mechanisms. Already covered.
- Pre-selected options, including separate privacy-invading or tagging as “the best price” with the least appealing seats.
- Forcing “updates,” that are actually only data scavenging, analytics or pushing ads.
- Faking scarcity for your funnels, that actually just reappear every certain time.
- Manipulative pricing. Hiding products costs elsewhere. Like a normal product costs $20 with $2 shipping cost, and the “deal” is $13 with $9 shipping.
- “Confirmshaming.” Shaming users to not agree to your offers and calls-to-action. Like instead of putting “no thanks,” putting “No, I want to continue my unhealthy habits.”
- Dark UX (user interfaces). Hiding or obscuring important information, making it difficult to make informed decisions like hiding some terms & conditions deep into the page, or with an almost unintelligible font with bad contrast. This also includes other dark practices, like showing fake messages like “31 people are also viewing this,” “3 tickets sold in the last 15 minutes,” with a natural countdown timer to get tickets for an event.
- Selectively show information. Hiding some attractive offers to push other offers, like in event seating or pushing their less-sold deals first as “timely offers.”
- Intense retargeting. Spamming ads (and possibly emails) to those who almost bought or already bought.
- Adding unchosen items to the shopping cart, so they must be actively removed.
- Disguising ads as articles from the site or interactive elements.
- Trick questions. Usually found along sign-up text areas, they ask permission to share information or having to actively select several checkboxes to unsubscribe. Also forcing annoying questionnaires in the way when unsubscribing as if the system needed a lot of information to know who is unsubscribing.

There is a website called hallofshame.design where you might find insightful examples of some of these dark patterns.

To a lesser extent, it’s easy that all businesses at least use one of these tactics at some point. This means that the line is thin between justifying that a trick actually helps a customer take action from simple greed to maximize conversions as fast as possible and give terrible service that blocks people from getting refunds. In many cases, the amount of the sale is symbolic to the target audience so they won’t even bother getting into the rabbit hole.

### A Note About Schemes

If we consider schemes, the above list becomes very only a part of a larger unethical game in business. Schemes take dark patterns further to the extreme to the almost illegal and illegal. But they are highly dependent on the specific business.

Spam emails that offer a questionable service that gets people by the numbers. Extreme bait-and-switch where a business lures people into an office for a great deal only to be pushed to the extreme into an expensive “membership.” Investments under exotic unique instruments where you don’t actually buy an asset but a representation, so the actual money is hidden (some crypto scams worked like this). Alternative unregulated banking that offers great returns (basically Ponzi schemes), multilevel marketing where you become the most hated person from your circle because you push ad nauseam the ploy to everyone you know. Bait and switch where a software company lures a lot of people into a software to then change its licensing. Harvesting a lot of personal information in social media to sell to brokers to be well ahead of their rivals.

I wouldn’t ever suggest to get this far in the scale. However, sadly, some well-known businesses use and abuse this kind of marketing, becoming highly profitable. Markets to capitalism are Darwinian, so ethics have no place, it’s just “eat or be eaten.”

## Propaganda

Propaganda is often used by an industry to push a highly idea with high profit potential that is politically relevant. Propaganda tricks people into thinking that the promoted idea is good by unison repetition from various interested parties, and also creates politics and regulations along it to create a capitalist haven where businesses can cash big on the scheme, so it can be said that it creates a trend of its own.

One example is the Electric Vehicle revolution. Elon Musk invested in a company called Tesla in the early 2000s, which then started making a sexy electrical roadster that made the news and opened the debate about the future of power in cars. The overall strategy, common in technological innovations, was one of price skimming their early models slowly as technology got cheaper, labor accumulated experience, and technological advances like self-driving kept the electric car revolution exciting. Propaganda is about sizzling until the steak is overcooked, or in other words, making big promises before they deliver the goods. Sometimes it works well, others, not so much. For instance, Tesla’s Cybertruck was sizzled at a launch event, promoted as a revolutionary, almost military grade truck with a unique geometric design, then its release date was pushed back, accumulating lots of pre-orders. It was then a success in 2024, but a smashing one? Debatable. Because of their protectionists and bigger than reality claims, as of 2024, the electric car revolution fell behind the Chinese who unveils exciting cars without sizzling. They have a car that floats on water and are overall more affordable than the American brands, and most of us learned about it after we saw it with our own eyes, not because a sizzling press release turned into an announcement event.

One could argue that in these cases, there were financial incentives of propagandizing. Sizzling the future launches did push Tesla’s stock high and companies that trade in stock love whatever can do that, especially if it means doing actually nothing to deserve it.

Such is the case of greenwashing. Because climate change is a hot political topic, efforts to make our way of living greener are made to reduce our environmental footprint. Sadly, a lot of these efforts are just propaganda. Such as commitments that by 2050 to have zero emissions while just pushing away the actual sacrifices needed while getting good ratings for the stock markets today, buying and selling credits by buying green protected parcels and simply using the color green in the logo to make the brand feel eco-responsible while hiding under the rug the copious amounts of contamination the business generates elsewhere to keep costs and its profile low.

Some countries take pride on having strong green regulations, but true capitalists simple evade them by moving manufacturing elsewhere that not only have much laxer green regulations but also pay lower wages, using whatever loopholes exist to comply with the finer points of the regulations of interest, especially when saying the place of origin of the product.

Not all businesses can benefit from outsourcing, though. However, it’s common that some kind of option to do business-as-usual while getting points for being green exists, such as buying credits that “greener” companies sell, to compensate for their lack of true greenness.

An oil engineer might be less optimistic about green policies, though. Since oil is the basis of all industries to some extent, and oil is an extremely dirty business environment-wise, it would be a true goal of a green environment to get rid of all oil-based products, but to achieve that, you would need to reset your life and the economy would need to reset itself. It is kind of funny that in order to live a true environmentally friendly environment, we would need to live similar to the ancient cultures, get rid of modern money ideas, modern city lifestyles and also of the industrial revolution. The comforts of modern life come at a cost we happily pass to the planet and many of its species.

And then, some people that are environment-sensitive get their dose by eating less industrialized foods, using the bicycle more and having solar energy panels. Propaganda also defines “how much is enough” so its socially acceptable. Politically, people usually want change, but not too much change. They want life conditions to get better, usually meaning reducing inflation, give affordable housing, making easy to start a business and such, but people don’t want to sacrifice their way of living for one that is truly beneficial to the environment, like processing their own waste, giving up their premium cars with climate control and nice air-conditioned office desks in a world where corporations don’t exist.

Propaganda is putting smiley faces to sugar-filled with empty nutritional value cereals marketed to kids, but it’s also putting colors to a toothbrush and good taste to toothpaste so a kid finds it fun to brush their teeth.

## Not everything is entirely good nor entirely bad.

We need at least some of the ideas propaganda to succeed in business.

As for copywriting and propaganda, be wary of using sizzling adjectives\*, evoking convoluted sentences (which translate as you not mastering your own discourse), and referring to your product as the solution and not a solution. There aren’t real magic pills, just products that may do wonders for a specific circumstance. All of these are consumed ideas and people can see right through them. However, repeat your big idea (three times is the charm!), simplify your communications to a basic level of English or another language, and verbalize similar to how your target audience speaks. This is better understood when you compare how different generations of people speak with each other.

Copywriting and by extension, marketing, isn’t about the sizzle. The sizzle is just a tactic that works for some cases. Even if it were about the sizzle, sizzling isn’t about promising an amazing thing that the buyers have never seen before (although occasionally that’s the case), but simply creating excitement for an upcoming product. Great sizzling needs to follow a certain recipe, like not showing the product itself, but just small parts of its components, in a vague way.

Movie trailers had this right before some of them spoiled the whole movie. Good trailers may focus on who is behind the movie, like its director or a brilliant actor. And then show just enough for a person to decide if the movie is relevant for them. Saying like “a historic drama,” or “the next epic adventure” (epic as in fantasy). But the trailer never gives out the plot, the tension, and much less, the resolution (finale). Just a seemingly random bunch of flashes from the movie.

Your product doesn’t even need to show those flashes, although it can show a bit of how you are making the product, a few laughs and random elements from your product making process.

### \* Avoiding Smokey Adjectives (and Copywriting Tips)

Smokey adjectives are words that are like makeup in a lady, it can embellish, refine a face, they can enamor, but smokey adjectives, like bad makeup, is as turn-off.

Some examples are: the best [-in-class], unbelievable, greatest, daunting, effective, fast, and so on. The problem with these is that they are opaque in meaning. In copywriting and marketing, being specific is the way. Companies that use smokey adjectives are the ones everyone says “ah, that’s just marketing” and a second friend will add, “they’ll say anything to sell.”

Use more specific phrasing instead and active voice, or power words that you later back up. Active voice makes the reader or viewer feel they’re in the situation live rather than simply being told a story. For instance, Rolls-Royce didn’t become famous in the sixties for saying it was the best luxury car, or the fastest luxury car, but instead, saying “At 60 miles an hour, the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock.”

This is how creativity must be used. To embellish your text with specific adjectives that points to something specific. In this case, it’s the idea of using “loudest noise” but the headline actually evokes the contrary, the car is silent even at high revolutions.

Power words or phrases are a good substitute for adjectives and adverbs in general. They are emotional, unique to the situation, relevant and actionable.

Some examples are:

- Action words: "Unlock", "Discover", "Transform", "Revolutionize", “Discover”.
- Emotional words: "Amazing", "Life-changing", "Unforgettable", "Exhilarating", “Unstoppable”.
- Urgency words: "Limited time", "Exclusive", "Last chance", " Hurry", “Now”.
- Benefit-focused words: "Proven", "Guaranteed", "Scientifically-tested", " Clinically-proven", “Free”.
- Social proof words: "Best-selling", "Award-winning", "Top-rated", "Recommended", “Sold-out”.
- Sensory words: "Delicious", "Vibrant", "Sleek", "Luxurious", “Breathtaking”.

Do you notice something about all these words? None end in -y or -ly. Keep that in mind. Especially in your headlines, sub-headlines and introductory sentences, use a describing and more powerful word. There are countless lists online.

These rules have exceptions, but try first using a power word rather than a smokey adjective or adverb. Adverbs make people feel they are actually reading something, like a book, instead of being in an entertaining conversation, which good copy tries to evoke.

Power words are unexpected. It’s saying a situation exploded rather that you angrily said words.

Proven copywriting grammar rules and proper writing rules are at odds. In copywriting we use what works best and just communicates, regardless of it being polished with the well-read word or correct grammar. As copywriters, we don’t care about sounding smart nor we want any literary prizes. We want people chant to our song.

This is also what good propaganda does. Your preferred presidential candidate did it. The companies you like do it. Even toy brands made us remember phrasings or even little songs.

Believe it or not, people enjoy a good sales pitch. It’s like magic, when the tricks are hidden away and the sales pitch can make people feel in awe and entertained, they invest in it. Just look at many of the iconic product launch events made by technology companies, a tailor that is a master in their craft suggesting your most flattering garment, or a good movie trailer. Even a scam can feel good for to the victim when well presented. But if the magic is weak, the magician without charisma, and the trick is filled with “cheap” tactics with obvious props, people run away. I’d hope that scammers were like these bad magicians, but sadly, many are quite good at their drift.

## Sometimes, business mislead for regulatory purposes.

In some cases, companies make “white lies” to avoid regulatory pressures. It’s understandable, as business owners, we want to avoid as many regulations as possible. Especially when we are not big companies that cannot sort complex and expensive scrutiny.

Such is the case of software companies that fake that they’re open-source providers. This means that they publish their source code for the world to see, along with a lax license that grants some rights to the public to use this code.

Open-source software is an initiative of the common man to be able to build software with the help of a community without needing to pay them. Anybody willing to contribute does it at their own time and expense.

Governments offer laxer regulations to open-source software companies, including that of intellectual property, copyright infringement, data related regulations and so on. Also, the term “open” has a lot of goodwill in the developer community as a preferred option over paid software. You see, “open” doesn’t necessarily mean free as in “free beer,” but free as in “free speech.” These open-washing companies (the -washing suffix comes from greenwashing we saw earlier in the chapter) publish their source code like any other open-source initiative, but you don’t see anyone from the community contributing. They usually don’t accept submissions. You can see how the portmanteau is simply used without good spirit. This affect AI models too, which comes with heavier scrutiny, where neither the Open-Source Initiative (a non-profit giving us some guidance of what open-source is and is conducted) nor regulatory agencies have had a clear definition of open-source artificial intelligence as of this writing, a few years after the boom happened in 2021. Admittedly, they might have a definition soon, at least the OSI, in which the regulatory agencies lean on as with the normal open-source definition.

You can find companies lying through deceptive marketing practices, for “good reason,” according to their interests. As annoying as regulations are, they exist for a reason, so no one takes advantage of the end user, and when regulations exist and companies develop clever legal strategies to avoid them, they fall into this gray area and it’s up to the people to expose them.
