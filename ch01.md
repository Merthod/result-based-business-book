# 1. The purpose of a business

Milton Friedman, a famed capitalist idealist, wrote a groundbreaking article in the New York Times titled “The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase Profits” more than fifty years ago.

Business people around you, from the local dry cleaner to the current top S&P500 corporations follow the principles outlined in the article, knowingly or not. This creates an environment of thousands, if not millions of businesses, focusing in increasing their own profits.

Milton argued that while shareholders could invest their money in whatever causes they desired, the primary responsibility of a business was to create value for the shareholders. This originally suggested the popular Gordon Gecko quote, “greed is good”, from the movie Wall Street.

The principles of this ideology immediately create a conflict for the business owner and investor. Since economics teaches us that there is no free lunch when producing goods and services (there’s always a cost, being environmental, social, labor and many others), then when thinking on the profits of our business, we become self-centered and our interests now misalign with those outside from us, like the community in which the business operates.

The focus on profits creates a coliseum where competition flourishes, and competition is key to justify the high costs of top-level managerial consultancy that sells the idea that a market is basically a jungle. This philosophy gives life to the Darwinian principles in an economy. Kill or be killed (bankrupt). Eat or be eaten (acquired). Only the most apt survives (innovation). A myriad of ideas that are pushed through various business-oriented degrees, academic books and business success stories.

Nowadays modern capitalist thinkers reinterpret the original Milton ideas, saying that modern corporations do care about the environment and not solely on their profits. But then they immediately go on to sell the idea on how caring for the environment is also good for profits. This creates a gray area in which dirty practices like greenwashing happens, which basically is publicly saying that your business is friendly to the environment while in reality it’s only marginally friendly to the environment, if not even worse.

And the government knows it, that is why it allows polluting businesses to buy “green credits” that compensates for their polluting practices, which is also oddly self-serving, like in buying acres of forests. The top-level consultants are happy with this kind of business practice: create a fire and then go and sell the fire extinguisher.

While we could argue that Milton ideas are ugly, they’re not wrong. If a business cannot produce profits, it can hardly drive interest from the shareholders and other type of investors, or even the owner's. Like what’s the point of a supplier giving you credit while knowing that your business isn’t profitable? If it’s not profitable, what gives the supplier confidence that you’ll pay them on time?

My only morally driven condition is not to lie nor omit. Don’t make things to appear what they’re not. Not because it is good or bad for business, but because we as humans depend on each other to survive. If we all take advantage of others, either by how we conduct business, how we negotiate in a predatory way, and hide under the rug the corruption, we behave as the “species” Darwing illustrated, effectively making of the market, a jungle.

Sadly, not because I don’t want you to do it doesn’t mean that others won’t do it to you, even the very rich. So be prepared, defend yourself, and even retaliate if you want to, but don’t make this the standard practice in your life. Good people deserve good business around them. Nasty people deserve (and expect) nasty business around them. And even somehow, they tend to be happy with it since it’s how they see the world. If you’re good to a nasty businessman, you’re weak in their eyes and they’ll go extra predatory on you. Not to mention that they won’t respect you. Also being too nice a businessman can open the door for abuse from nasty businesspeople.

The solution to this is common sense. Common sense comes with a balanced mix of experience and knowledge of the various business practices in the world, industry and community. It is the base of everything that you’re going to see in this book forward.

Business on its own is a field affected by the culture, written and unwritten laws of where the business runs.

Having said this, the sole purpose of a business is to make a customer.

That's the top priority. Only after a business has grown, they start having other priorities they shouldn't, like pleasing shareholders. And so, many growing businesses also lose direction and with it, they lose the customer's loyalty. So how do they defend themselves? By carving some legal custom definition of a monopoly is, like a "creative monopoly", that uses network effects, probably some shady tactics too and whatever resource they can get a hold of to marginally comply with regulations not to be sued for behaving like an anti-trust or monopolistic.

Bear in mind this: to make that customer loyal, first you must show that you're loyal to them.

What I’m about to tell you may be slightly different in where you plan perform business, say getting partners, investors, suppliers, employees, clients and/or customers.
