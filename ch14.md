# 14. Strategic Vision of Selling 202: The Power of Sales Funnels and Brand Process

In the Strategic Vision of Selling 101, we focused on the sales process in a generic way, which is mostly face to face. While this can be an effective way to build some riches, most entrepreneurs I have worked with tend to prefer the more scalable way of selling. This is the sales funnel.

The sales funnel has existed for decades, even before the Internet. The classic ways were telemarketing, an approach many marketers still suggest. The other is direct response advertising, the cornerstone of results-based marketing.

In direct-response advertising, marketers rented a number of addresses from a listing broker. The listing broker organizes their listings by the classic database-driven marketing metrics, RFM. They have many lists of people based on recency of purchase, frequency, and monetary value of the offer. It was understood that hot buyers were usually open to buying more than cold buyers (people whose last purchase was made months ago). As a marketer, you wanted sizzling hot buyers.

Direct-response advertisers first rented a small sample of the listing to make a test. They also hired some mailing expert agency that could print and send letters the old way in first class, meaning using the same postage a friend would use, not a cheaper second-class where the letter could get lost in the way. These agencies made sure that the envelope sold itself to be opened up. To do that, the letter shouldn’t look like a promotional letter, but put the foot in the door somehow. Some iconic letters were right to the point, such as putting “money inside”. That would make anybody open the letter. They used a “grabber”, a real 1 dollar note stuck on the top of the letter that made the person open the letter to get it. Some other letters used whatever cheap and interesting gizmo they could use as a grabber to make sure people tear up the envelope and see inside, from novelty toys to small tools. It didn’t have to make logical sense for the offer, but the copywriter was creative enough to use a hook for the grabber to make sense to the offer or value proposition. For instance, the dollar bill could be used to show how you save people money. They could also make the letter look official to evoke some emotion, or have a handwritten note on the top to make it feel more personal. Or a keychain, fake checks, casino-looking chip, good luck charms, whatever fits.

The letter would be an art piece by itself. Most of us would study many letters that sold millions upon millions of dollars. Some copywriters went deep as to analyze the flow, tone, wording, sentence length, layout, and so on. An old advice to get the feel of writing copy was to copy, by hand, successful letters, word by word. Others criticize this as useless. I’m a bit neutral on that, but I suggest you do it a few times to see if it works for you. The more need you see of being a great copy salesman, the more sense it makes to try it. When I started, I really sucked at this, so I was a great prospect to try it. As a tip, I suggest you do it away from any technological distractions because you won’t focus 100%. So, no checking your email every 5 minutes, or seeing status updates, or taking a selfie of you doing the homework (maybe until you finish).

Imagine having the power of selling millions upon millions of dollars from words you write. Being able to turn strangers into buyers who know, like, and trust you. Remember that: know, like, and trust.

I didn’t mail a single letter the old way, but I did make a few for specific individuals to put the foot in the door for myself.

This kind of mailing is expensive but flexible, since you don’t have to mail thousands of people at a time, but a few, and scale based on that. If the letter works, it will work immediately. Some letters would include a return or reply letter already stamped to make it as easy as possible to send the reply as efficiently as possible.

But then came the internet.

Mostly by leveraging email sequences and web pages, which contained the web version of the sales letter, with much more efficient response mechanisms since a click can place an order instantly. This is especially good thanks to Amazon’s expired 1-click purchase patent in the USA. Then other mechanisms were added, like SMS, instant messaging, QR codes, user accounts, and apps. And then you have all the kinds of websites that do some kind of commerce. From the simple shop that sells chairs to the complex marketplace that lists all manufacturers from a country and lets international buyers buy from them. From the paid monthly newsletter to the “Software as a Service” (or similar) that lets you offer some tool, infrastructure, or recurring service online.

The web has matured since the 2010s when habits were established for the masses on how the web is used and leveraged. This let marketing service providers, such as email providers and website creators, create structured, automated sales processes, leveraging the new list brokers, the data brokers, such as Meta, Google, and TikTok.

The direct-response online sales process is born from three simple steps:

1.  Have a landing page.
2.  Ask for an email.
3.  Present an offer.

A landing page is whatever page you make to captivate the interest of an audience based on a traffic source.

For instance, if you optimize for search or any other organic source (like non-paid YouTube or TikTok), it may be “how to stop a divorce”, or “how to get customers for a coffee shop in Houston”. Search can be nationwide (sometimes even international) or local. In any case, leverage the tools search engines provide to enhance your listings. But I digress; the pages that have a similar title, sometimes exact, from what a user might type or ask AI to search is the landing page. In this case, it is content-based.

If you optimize from a paid source, you are freer to make the landing page more about sizzling than bringing the steak (sorry if you’re a vegetarian). It can be something like “7 questions to ask a real estate broker before renting an apartment in Houston” or “Stop your divorce” (yes, some can work in paid media too). The landing page may have much less content, but only sell free access to a report only by entering a working email (that the email provider will verify if you want by sending a confirmation email the user has to access and click on a link to get to the desired content). The only way to verify an email is by sending an email and having the person click a link or reply to it. There’s no other way, no matter how many black belts your web developer might have.

Well, I got ahead of myself. In any case, after your landing page, you might offer something enticing. The only cost is entering a working email (preferably the one you use). Consider it as ethical bribing. “Give me your email and your permission to send some useful and timely messages that are on the topic that interests you and I give you Y”. Usually, emails are easier to get than phone numbers, but in your specific case, you might want to test that option too. Many websites or even social media posts may be less elegant (but not less effective in principle \*) by asking people to send a WhatsApp message to get it with the added benefit that there you can actually start a one-to-one conversation.

## \* Ownership versus control

When discussing the history of capitalist wealth, you eventually learn that the Rockefeller family, back in the 70s, in their iconic building in New York, had an entire floor full of lawyers managing their wealth. Using the many types of trusts, they hid ownership of their properties, but not control. This is why it’s almost impossible to gauge how much wealth these top capitalist families have. According to this philosophy, control is way more important than ownership. This is true in having businesses and you use sophisticated tax and business strategies to have as much control as you can of your own wealth, like in moving assets, selling them, capital gains, estate management, and so on.

Maybe the only big exception in the ownership versus control is in marketing. Many businesses do effectively reach an audience through a social platform. Name whatever you like: YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Google Maps (for local), and so on. The problem is that unless they use a funnel like the one described earlier, they’re not developing a durable competitive advantage, since they do not have their own audience. These audiences from social media are like a social loan. They give you access, but the owner of those lists of people are the social media corporations.

Back in the early 2010s, Facebook was the heavy hitter in social platforms, especially through their Pages offering. You could host a page there, similar to a web page. The cool thing about these pages is that the more fans you had, the more eyeballs saw the updates organically. You didn’t have to spend anything to push an offer and have people buy something. You spent very little money to get as many fans as quickly as possible, and then you sold organically. It was a golden era for e-commerce.

As the Facebook Ads platform grew, their rules quickly changed. Organic traffic went down, but still, you could get cheap clicks. However, a trend started to show itself. By around 2016, organic traffic was catatonic and you had to be creative in your organic ways to keep this strategy going. By 2018, organic traffic was completely dead. But also, Facebook was losing its mass appeal in favor of Instagram. Just a few years later, TikTok appeared and revived what true social is, but with their own rules. You could argue that Twitter was still pure social, but the audience there was much more niched, and you can hardly get a generic kind of audience there because there’s no great interest-based metrics and demographics there, as opposed to the rivals.

As Meta and other companies have abused their control and ownership advantage (they set the rules) of how they extract data from their users and sell it to anyone, you can easily see your audience there disappear or become much more difficult or expensive to access.

The lesson here is that you don’t have either ownership or control of those audiences. Just some very limited access, either organic or paid, because even in paid, you have to open your wallet wide to access the full lists. Not cheap at all.

So, the direct-response advertiser will somehow funnel that lent traffic to some place of their ownership and control. Most typically, their email list. When an email marketer sends an email, they reach every single valid address they have in the list. Provided that it’s not a crappy email, spammy, unknown domain, bad reputation, and some other rules that exist to reduce the no-value emails that spam every inbox in the world. Check the blacklisted words to avoid using in emails to avoid damaging your reputation, since these words can trigger spam filters.

Sending emails is also much cheaper than running ads with all the work related to them, like ad exposure exhaustion, testing different landing pages or offers, or having your ad moderated or your ads account suspended for any random reason.

The many funnels to model The funnel we saw before is the most basic there is.

A more sophisticated funnel would require some specialized tracking tools to trigger some specific actions, such as cart abandonment, but before we delve into that, we’ll see only a slightly better funnel that uses sales maximizers. Now that sounds fun!

The basic funnel was: Landing page → Email opt-in → Offer/sales/product page

Now we’ll enhance it with the next step. Landing page → Email opt-in → Offer/sales/product page → Upsell #1 page

Now, the upsell page will have two options: yes, and no. If yes, Checkout page. Or Upsell #2 page with two options too, but the negative one is just skipping the yes option to the Checkout page. If no, Downsell page, if yes, then checkout with it, if no, checkout without it.

Finally, you have the Confirmation page that shows the transaction completed successfully and optionally provide some next step, like checking their email, or suggest some other offerings they might like.

### What’s an upsell and a downsell?

An upsell is offering more of what they already want. It might be one of three options: a bundle (like for $3 more, “you want fries and soda with your burger?”), more of the same product (buy 5 for the price of 4), or a cross-sell (say buying a photographic camera with some photographic course).

An upsell can be much more expensive than the original offer. There’s no set limit; the only limit is based on understanding of your ideal buyers. If in doubt, you could alternatively test different upsells and see which performs the best. Say you divide 10,000 visits half with one upsell. The worst case is not offering anything.

An upsell can also be a one-time offer, meaning that if they don’t act right there and then, they won’t be able to buy whatever the upsell is at the same price, or at all.

A downsell is the middle ground between the original offer and the upsell. It may include a free trial of something or an appealing smaller upsell at a low price.

As a rule of thumb, it’s not recommended that you offer more than two upsells and one downsell. Since a downsell is the middle ground between the cart and a specific upsell, there’s exactly one downsell per upsell. You would have up to three sales maximizers in this sales funnel.

Also, don’t hide the link to continue to checkout if they just want to skip the upsell. You usually find it below the upsell and the upsell itself doesn’t take much screen estate. Think of it as an image and a checkbox (optional) below it specifying the exact upsell offer. One could argue the skip link should be visible above the fold (without having to scroll) at the bottom of the screen. It should be clear the distinction to continue with the upsell and without it. Usually, the upsell checkout button is more decorated and the skip link is just a standard-looking link.

## More types of sales funnels

Funnels come in a lot of varieties (flows) and formats.

We have focused on funnels based on web pages because they are the most used today still, but they can also add SMS messages, messengers, downloading apps, and email. They can also use many formats, like qualification questionnaires, quizzes, demos, free downloads, trials, unlocking features for a freemium product, or gamification techniques (points, awards, recognition, badges, discounts, bonuses, coupons…)

Especially as you add complexity to your funnel with segmenting technologies to reach people who added a product to a cart but then exited or visited the checkout page and exit there.

In sales, that would be the follow-up that would be through a phone call. Leveraging ad platforms and your marketing platform (CRM tools such as your email marketing provider and analytics), you can mimic this by serving ads or send automated messages or emails that invite them to complete the purchase.

In whatever media you can realistically checkout (ask for payment), you can create a funnel around.

## If unsure, avoid complexity

Don’t add pages or layers of complexity to your funnels just because.

If unsure, start from the most basic funnel and test your way up by adding one upsell, then the downsell, then the second upsell.

You can duplicate funnels and trigger one from an ad and another from your emailing to get distinct easy analytics or configure cohorts in your analytics platform to segment traffic by source or the sale by the pertinent attribution (again, an ad, email, direct or other sources) during a period of time.

Alternatively, you can model another successful funnel from someone who sells to the same market as you. But you must know that it is successful, as you may otherwise be modeling failure. Take note from funnels that made you buy or ask friends and family about their online experiences to see what made them tick and look it up. Note that modeling isn’t copying. Their funnel may have specific parameters, like pricing, copy, and upsells that work well for the USP and competitive advantages they manage to have that may not work for you at all.

### What can you model?

You might model the layout, the overall tone, test pricing ranges, overall look and feel, as well as graphics. The layout includes how long the page is, how it is segmented, how and when testimonials are placed.

If you look around, you might find many funnels and get ideas for the type of business you want to build. Like a funnel for digital products, webinars (to sell high-ticket digital products or services), for SaaS (software-as-a-service) or XaaS (anything-as-a-service), for a specific kind of physical product, to get trials, and so on.

More so, if you are modeling a funnel that also caters to your specific audience, check the level of awareness the page is using to communicate its ideas.

## The levels of awareness

These levels reflect the level of knowledge and understanding of an audience to a specific offering.

An offering implies a marketing promise that a problem will be resolved.

So, the promise implies there’s a solution to a problem.

A solution implies there’s a pesky problem that makes people spend some resources trying to fix. It may be time, money, or energy. Energy meaning there’s too much effort, complexity, or wasted energy throughout the process.

So what? Take an audience of ten thousand people loosely qualified to be your buyer. Say in a trade exposition.

If you got a microphone and got to talk to all of them directly at once and simply stated your offer as you might see in a typical advertising “buy X and get a 5% discount”, you will cater to only a few of them. On average, from 1 to 3%, but it can be zero. For an audience of 10,000, this is only 100 to 300 people on average.

For you, this might look like a win, if we say there’s a $500 profit per sale, then there’s 50k to 150k on the table.

But is that all you can do?

No, it isn’t.

There’s a potential market right there of 5 million. That’s the real table. Taking only 100k from it might seem like peanuts as you realize other salespeople might take a whole bunch more.

That’s why it’s crucial to speak up to the lowest level of awareness of an audience.

In the lowest end of awareness, there are the people who have a problem but don’t even realize it is a problem yet. Let’s relive the divorce example. There are people who are having a bad marriage but are somehow okay with it and just dealing with it somehow. There may be a wish to be better, but they simply don’t connect the dots or see a problem clearly. Maybe that’s how the marriage has been the whole time or they rationalize it’s the cost of being together for so long.

These are the unconscious and they can be about 30 to 60% of an audience. To impact these people, the most powerful resource you have is story. Using a story of a marriage that will guide them through familiar places and moments, and then show there’s a problem and a way to solve it.

That’s why some movies about domestic violence do also social service by educating people who suffer it and watch it that it’s not good, there’s no need to endure it, and there’s help readily available if they’re willing to ask.

You don’t need to make a movie, of course. But having a story that introduces your product within a context. Showing the struggle, how much time, money, or energy someone realized was being wasted. See it is a problem and then finding a solution for it.

However, not all products need to sell themselves through the problem-solution way. It might just be a fun story of adventure, romantic intrigue, aspirations, or any other latent emotion that makes it entertaining to buy as they make people feel like part of the story. It can be as simple as making the reader feel like a Caribbean pirate or a lady feel like a modern princess with an old-timey heart. This showcases an opportunity that can be timely, time-sensitive, endearing, or simply fun.

An opportunity can be shown also as a problem-solution, but different. It’s not a painful problem to a satisfactory solution. But a problem based on perception (like boredom, expectancy) and an entertaining solution. Like a movie. One goes to fix boredom by going to the movies or being expectant to watch a movie they have been waiting for.

This applies to social selling too. Brands or personalities that develop a following and then create products. This is expectancy of a movement, where the product itself can also fix a functional problem by itself (dry skin, personal finance control, affordable organic makeup, and so on). So, you add to a functional solution (what the product’s result or functional), a psychological solution (what your brand helps the product be perceived as).

Note: There is another interpretation of what social selling is pertaining to sales as a profession. It is leveraging social media, especially Twitter/X and LinkedIn to avoid gatekeepers and reach decision-makers directly. You need to position yourself as a problem-solver, not a salesman, to do so and you need to create custom openers and not generic personal messages. This is usually done for high-ticket products, so personalization is recommended.

Going back to the levels of awareness.

The lowest level, the unconscious, are between 30-60% of the audience. The second lowest are the problem aware people, that is about 10-15%. Then the solution aware, 10-15%. Then the promise aware, 10-15%. Finally, the offer aware, the final 1-5%.

If you want to appeal to the problem-aware people up, you need to lead with the problem you’re solving or the gap (e.g., boredom, unfulfilled expectation).

If you want to appeal to the solution-aware people up, you need to lead with the solution.

The promise is a generic term relating to the brand, knowing the company’s USP or “their deal” like “oh yes, they’re big players that make manufacturing robots or something like that”.

The offer is awareness to the specific offering. If you don’t work at a dealership, nor actively looking for a Mustang, but know right now what’s the deal and terms to buy a restored Mustang ’67 from the distributor you know, you’re in that 3-5%.

In a typical sales environment when a CEO needs a solution to a problem through a product, but isn’t aware of any players, offerings nor options, they’ll ask for recommendations and trust more those that are aware of offerings over promises, unless the people they ask have their own weight into the recommendation. Like another CEO or other C-level executives versus a family member.

The higher up in the awareness scale, the more trust the potential buyer has. This means that your message need not be long-form and filled with testimonials if they already have the trust.

Salespeople know when to zip it when the sales situation is closing. If they just keep talking after the buyer has made up their mind, they’ll start getting tired of them, doubt, get annoyed, and other slew of bad vibes that will kill the sales. A sad situation to be in.

In your sales pages, if you are aiming for the lower levels of awareness, it’s not a bad idea that you add your call-to-action buttons sprinkled so they don’t have to scroll to the bottom or wait for the full video to almost end to see the button.

Some sales pitches will open with a story dramatizing an uncomfortable or boring situation, like a manager being left behind in the room when higher-level executives at a corporation go out for a meal together. Then the story is driven towards the offering. It may be lack of personal skills, bad personal image, not being visually perceived as part of the group.

The lower the awareness level, the more about them the content should be and the less about the product itself. The star in the story isn’t the product nor your company, it’s the buyer.

Master direct-response copywriters know how to craft letters that will appeal to the full audience, leaving very little on the table. Even when crafting the offer itself. They will do it simply by appealing to the lowest end of the awareness levels, and then follow up with a higher-level advertising. Like if a person watched 50% of a video, you know that if you retarget this person, they probably don’t need to watch the full thing now, they may skip to the problem-solution or promise.

The offer shouldn’t be the same for those who are just getting familiar with your market than those who are already loyal customers. You may offer strong risk reversal for all, but it will probably have a greater impact for those who are still on the ropes and their trust yet to be earned.

This is why many companies that don’t add risk reversal create entry-level products and tripwires\* to get the trust as quickly as possible, plus a guarantee that lets the buyer experience the quality of the company’s service.

- A tripwire is an extremely affordable product, many times a loss-leader, that completely takes out price as an objection since that money is likely not going to be missed. It’s like a $1 USD trial, a $10 USD book or the trickier, “free book, only pay for shipping”. It’s money your base could easily give away as a tip without any thought.

These strategies are great for a strategic objective, getting the second sale as quickly as possible. You see, the first sale is usually a loser because this sale profits are eaten up by the customer acquisition costs (CAC). As a general rule, it is from the second sale where the profit is made. If you make the first purchase as easy as possible, it’s a lot easier to ask for the next one at a normal price, or get a subscription going. Also, the sooner you get the second sale, the more likely it is that the buyer will continue buying.

### I’m confused, can I simply state the offer?

In a word, no.

Unless you know that those who will see the message already know, like, and trust you, it is recommended leading with something else and leave the offer later in the message.

Marketing is a positioning game, and positioning happens in the mind of the consumer. This means that to get better acceptance for your offer, you need to position it. This is why you lead with a story for people who are unsure they know about the problem. By guiding them through the process from being aware there is a problem, recognize the need for a solution, consider your solution among others, and finally see why they should buy from you (USP), you make sure they will likely buy from you.

Sales is a capsule within a marketing process. We have seen how sales funnels are made and how to tailor your message for the best acceptance possible.

To help the sales funnel perform better, a marketing funnel may help you pre-qualify, pre-motivate, pre-dispose, pre-interest, and yes, even pre-close.

If you’re thinking, “I’ve seen these before”, I’ll tell you, yes you have. We introduced these ideas when we talked about brands back in chapter 10.
