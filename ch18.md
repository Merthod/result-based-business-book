# 18. After the Sale

Selling never truly stops. A business develops relationships because business is human, and relationships make the process of doing business much easier. If you provide professional services, such as web design, it’s common for clients to ask for additional services after you deliver the final product, like creating content for social media (including videos) or platforms to manage a business online (ERP).

It’s only natural that if you made a wonderful website, clients might think you’ll do wonderful social media content too. You can be open and say yes, learning as you go, knowing you’ll do a better job than they could themselves. Alternatively, if you are a more resourceful business, you might work out a deal with an expert, either getting a fee for recommending them or outsourcing the job to a white-label business (they do the work using your name). In some cases, you might just recommend the expert and move on to the next website project.

In any case, a great business treats marketing as an investment rather than a gamble. This means you have a machine of repeat customers alongside customer acquisitions. This means you keep in touch with your customers for three reasons:

- You care about them and have updates for them, such as reminders for a next service.
- You have recommendations that are beneficial to them, either yours or affiliate.
- You have news.

For most businesses, the most common reason is the third: you have news. Smart marketers build a relationship with their audience by sharing their own news: their learnings, interesting stories, case studies, even personal anecdotes somehow tied to the niche (like a weird fishing adventure or an unusual way to lure fish that worked like magic).

They send at least an email a week with news. The goal is simple: you don’t want them to forget about you. People are forgetful, even those who showed great interest in you can quickly forget they even met you as life distracts them.

Think of this like fishing for attention. You want to lure their attention to your hook and keep them psychologically close. You want to be the first one they think about when your niche becomes a subject.

A mix of content is advisable. Say your main reason to keep in touch is you have news; you can mix it up with an occasional product recommendation (luring them to a new funnel) of yours or a third-party, and the reminders.

If you want to be more sophisticated, you might use some old database marketing magic to segment your audiences into RFM, based on recency, frequency, and monetary value to recommend up-sells, cross-sells, launches (new funnels), one-time offers, affiliate pitches, buying events (like liquidations or free-shipping days). Remember that a hot lead is still hot right after they buy. They get cold as time goes by without any kind of follow-up.

The cool thing about after-sale service is that a lot of it can be automated through inviting them to funnels, programming emails through your email marketing service, or broadcasting your news, creating say 5 emails a day and spreading the delivery every two or three days for the next two weeks, for example.

### What to Promote After the Sale?

First, you might consider surveying your buyer with a customer satisfaction survey, like the NPS score, in which you give a 1-10 scale and ask, “How likely is it that you would recommend X to a friend?” Only 8-10 is acceptable; anything less means something is seriously wrong. You might want to add an open question to elaborate: “What can we do better?” and optimize the buying experience with your learnings. There are NPS plugins to quickly and easily add this ability, or use a surveying service with a custom NPS page for your buyers in their system. If they give you a rave score, ask them to leave a review a couple of days after (if immediate access) or by the delivery date.

Second, you might consider recommending complementary products, the main upsell, or a catalog in PDF or browsable on a site, from immediately to a few days after (test it). Then some time after, recommend broader products so they know what else you’ve got and any news or recommendations. Keep them spaced out, and stop after a week or two. Then you might want to keep them in a broader customer list for them to engage in some new funnel.

### What Does Engaging Them Into a New Funnel Mean?

It means using email or messaging to invite them to a fresh funnel, where they opt-in (again put their email) to show interest in getting more information.

Some sites that have strong database customizations might skip the opt-in form but have some kind of call-to-action to show their interest in a new sales page (naturally the website already can link their email to the list). The call-to-action can come from the email or message itself linking directly to the new sales page.

If using an opt-in, just make sure to enable autocomplete to help them quickly fill out the form and move on.

### A Note About Autocompleting Forms

Autocompleting forms is a popular way to quickly fill forms on websites. This includes names, addresses, and phone numbers. There is a security risk from fellow sellers but with little ethics. Some may add more fields than needed, but hide them in the page, so when a user autofills the form, they don’t notice they’re filling hidden fields too. These days many businesses scavenge data like crazy, and sell them around. This is how it is almost impossible today to hide our emails from spammers. Security software might red-flag a page that adds hidden fields, so check the HTML code if you’re using some provider service or plugins; you can’t trust anyone, especially when adding third-party packages to your site.
